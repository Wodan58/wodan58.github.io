<h1 id="overview-of-the-language-joy">Overview of the language JOY</h1>
<p><em>by Manfred von Thun</em></p>
<p>Joy is a functional programming language which is significantly
different from other programming languages of that kind. This paper
provides an overview of most of its practical and theoretical
aspects.</p>
<p>To add two integers, say 2 and 3, and to write their sum, you type
the program</p>
<pre><code>        2  3  +</code></pre>
<p>This is how it works internally: the first numeral causes the integer
2 to be pushed onto a stack. The second numeral causes the integer 3 to
be pushed on top of that. Then the addition operator pops the two
integers off the stack and pushes their sum, 5. The system reads inputs
like the above and executes them when they are terminated by a period
<code>"."</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>        2  3  + .</code></pre>
<p>In the default mode there is no need for an explicit output
instruction, so the numeral <code>5</code> is now written to the output
file which normally is the screen. So, in the default mode the
terminating <code>"."</code> may be taken to be an instruction to write
the top element of the stack. In what follows the terminating period
will not be shown any further.</p>
<p>To compute the square of an integer, it has to be multiplied by
itself. To compute the square of the sum of two integers, the sum has to
be multiplied by itself. Preferably this should be done without
computing the sum twice. The following is a program to compute the
square of the sum of 2 and 3:</p>
<pre><code>        2  3  +  dup  *</code></pre>
<p>After the sum of 2 and 3 has been computed, the stack just contains
the integer 5. The dup operator then pushes another copy of the 5 onto
the stack. Then the multiplication operator replaces the two integers by
their product, which is the square of 5. The square is then written out
as 25. Apart from the <code>dup</code> operator there are several others
for re-arranging the top of the stack. The pop operator removes the top
element, and the swap operator interchanges the top two elements.</p>
<p>A <em>list</em> of integers is written inside square brackets. Just
as integers can be added and otherwise manipulated, so lists can be
manipulated in various ways. The following concatenates two lists:</p>
<pre><code>        [1 2 3]  [4 5 6 7]  concat</code></pre>
<p>The two lists are first pushed onto the stack. Then the
<code>concat</code> operator pops them off the stack and pushes the list
<code>[1 2 3 4 5 6 7]</code> onto the stack. There it may be further
manipulated or it may be written to the output file.</p>
<p>Joy makes extensive use of <em>combinator</em>s. These are like
operators in that they expect something specific on top of the stack.
But unlike operators they execute what they find on top of the stack,
and this has to be the <em>quotation</em> of a program, enclosed in
square brackets. One of these is a combinator for mapping elements of
one list via a function to another list. Consider the program</p>
<pre><code>        [1 2 3 4]  [dup *]  map</code></pre>
<p>It first pushes the list of integers and then the quoted program onto
the stack. The <code>map</code> combinator then removes the list and the
quotation and constructs another list by applying the program to each
member of the given list. The result is the list <code>[1 4 9 16]</code>
which is left on top of the stack.</p>
<p>In <em>definition</em>s of new functions no formal parameters are
used, and hence there is no substitution of actual parameters for formal
parameters. After the following definition</p>
<pre><code>        square   ==   dup  *</code></pre>
<p>the symbol <code>square</code> can be used in place of
<code>dup *</code>.</p>
<p>As in other programming languages, definitions may be recursive, for
example in the definition of the factorial function. That definition
uses a certain recursive pattern that is useful elsewhere. In Joy there
is a combinator for <em>primitive recursion</em> which has this pattern
built in and thus avoids the need for a definition. The primrec
combinator expects two quoted programs in addition to a data parameter.
For an integer data parameter it works like this: If the data parameter
is zero, then the first quotation has to produce the value to be
returned. If the data parameter is positive then the second has to
combine the data parameter with the result of applying the function to
its predecessor. For the factorial function the required quoted programs
are very simple:</p>
<pre><code>        [1]  [*]  primrec</code></pre>
<p>computes the factorial recursively. There is no need for any
definition. For example, the following program computes the factorial of
<code>5</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        5  [1]  [*]  primrec</code></pre>
<p>It first pushes the number <code>5</code> and then it pushes the two
short quoted programs. At this point the stack contains three elements.
Then the <code>primrec</code> combinator is executed. It pops the two
quotations off the stack and saves them elsewhere. Then
<code>primrec</code> tests whether the top element on the stack
(initially the <code>5</code>) is equal to zero. If it is, it pops it
off and executes one of the quotations, the <code>[1]</code> which
leaves <code>1</code> on the stack as the result. Otherwise it pushes a
decremented copy of the top element and recurses. On the way back from
the recursion it uses the other quotation, <code>[*]</code>, to multiply
what is now a factorial on top of the stack by the second element on the
stack. When all is done, the stack contains <code>120</code>, the
factorial of <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>As may be seen from this program, the usual branching of recursive
definitions is built into the combinator. The <code>primrec</code>
combinator can be used with many other quotation parameters to compute
quite different functions. It can also be used with data types other
than integers. Joy has many more combinators which can be used to
calculate many functions without forcing the user to give recursive or
non-recursive definitions. Some of the combinators are more
data-specific than <code>primrec</code>, and others are far more
general.</p>
<p>Joy programs are built from smaller programs by just two operations:
<em>concatenation</em> and <em>quotation</em>. Concatenation is a binary
operation, and since it is associative it is best written in infix
notation and hence no parentheses are required. Since concatenation is
the only binary operation of its kind, in Joy it is best written without
an explicit symbol. Quotation is a unary operation which takes as its
operand a program. In Joy the quotation of a program is written by
enclosing it in square brackets. Ultimately all programs are built from
atomic programs which do not have any parts. The semantics of Joy has to
explain what the atomic programs mean, how the meaning of a concatenated
program depends on the meaning of its parts, and what the meaning of a
quoted program is. Moreover, it has to explain under what conditions it
is possible to replace a part by an equivalent part while retaining the
meaning of the whole program.</p>
<p>Joy programs denote functions which take one argument and yield one
value. The argument and the value are <em>state</em>s consisting of at
least three components. The principal component is a <em>stack</em>, and
the other components are not needed here. Much of the detail of the
semantics of Joy depends on specific properties of programs. However,
central to the semantics of Joy is the following:</p>
<p>The concatenation of two programs denotes the composition of the
functions denoted by the two programs.</p>
<p>Function composition is associative, and hence denotation maps the
associative syntactic operation of program concatenation onto the
associative semantic operation of function composition. The quotation of
a program denotes a function which takes any state as argument and
yields as value the same state except that the quotation is pushed onto
the stack. One part of a concatenation may be replaced by another part
denoting the same function while retaining the denotation of the whole
concatenation. One quoted program may be replaced by another denoting
the same function only in a context where the quoted program will be
dequoted by being executed. Such contexts are provided by the
<em>combinator</em>s of Joy. These denote functions which behave like
higher order functions in other languages.</p>
<p>The above may be summarised as follows: Let <code>P</code>,
<code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code> and <code>R</code> be programs, and let
<code>C</code> be a combinator. Then this principle holds:</p>
<pre><code>        IF          Q1      ==      Q2
        THEN     P  Q1  R   ==   P  Q2  R
        AND        [Q1] C   ==     [Q2] C</code></pre>
<p>The principle is the prime rule of inference for the <em>algebra of
Joy</em> which deals with the equivalence of Joy programs, and hence
with the identity of functions denoted by such programs. A few laws in
the algebra can be expressed without combinators, but most require one
or more combinators for their expression.</p>
<p>Joy programs denote functions which take <em>state</em>s as arguments
and as values. Programs are built from atomic programs which also denote
functions which take states as arguments and as values. The meaning of
compound programs has to be given in terms of the meanings of atomic
programs. It is useful to classify atomic programs into categories
depending on what kind of function they denote. A coarse classification
distinguishes just three, called</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the <em>literal</em>s,</li>
<li>the <em>operator</em>s and</li>
<li>the <em>combinator</em>s.</li>
</ol>
<p>Firstly, the <em>literal</em> atomic programs are those which look
like constants in conventional languages. They comprise literal numbers
(or, more correctly, numerals) such as integers, and other literals of
type character, string, truth value and set. Literals do not denote
numbers, characters, strings and so on, but they denote functions which
take one state as argument and yield as value another state which is
like the argument state except that the value of the literal has been
pushed onto the stack component.</p>
<p>Secondly, the <em>operator</em> atoms are those which look like
<em>n</em>-ary operators in other languages. They include the operations
such as for addition and the other arithmetical operations, and for the
various operations on other types. Like all programs, operators denote
functions from states to states, but the functions are not defined on
all states. An <em>n</em>-ary operator (such as the binary addition
operator) denotes a function which is defined only on states whose stack
component has <em>n</em> items (such as two integers) on top. The
function yields as value another state which is like the argument state
except that the <em>n</em> items on the stack have been replaced by the
result (such as the sum). Also included as operators are those atoms
denoting mere structural functions of the stack component such as
<code>dup</code>, <code>swap</code> and <code>pop</code>, and those that
involve input and output such as <code>get</code> and
<code>put</code>.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the <em>combinator</em> atoms are like operators in that
they require the top of the stack to contain certain items. But unlike
operators, they do not treat these items as passive data. Instead they
execute these items - and hence those items must be quoted programs. So,
combinators also denote functions which are defined only on states
having the appropriate number of quoted programs on top of the stack.
They yield as values another state which depends on the argument state,
including the quoted programs, and on the combinator itself.</p>
<p>Literals, operators and combinators can be concatenated to form
<em>program</em>s. These may then be enclosed in square brackets to form
literal <em>quotation</em>s. Such literals are not atomic, but if they
occur in a program they are treated just like other literals: they cause
the quoted program to be pushed onto the stack. So, literal quotations
denote functions which take any stack as argument and yield as value
another stack which is like the argument stack except that it has the
quotation pushed on top. Quotations on top of the stack can be treated
like other values, they can be manipulated, taken apart and combined,
but they can also be executed by combinators. If a quotation contains
only literals, then it is a <em>list</em>. The component literals do not
have to be of the same type, and they may include further quotations. If
a list is executed by a combinator, then its components are pushed onto
the stack.</p>
<p>Concatenation of Joy programs denote the composition of the functions
which the concatenated parts denote. Hence if <code>Q1</code> and
<code>Q2</code> are programs which denote the same function and
<code>P</code> and <code>R</code> are other programs, then the two
concatenations <code>P Q1 R</code> and <code>P Q2 R</code> also denote
the same function. In other words, programs <code>Q1</code> and
<code>Q2</code> can replace each other in concatenations. This can serve
as a rule of inference for <em>rewriting</em>. As premises one needs
axioms such as in the first three lines below, and definitions such as
in the fourth line:</p>
<pre><code>(+)                2  3  +   ==   5
(dup)              5  dup    ==   5  5
(*)                5  5  *   ==   25
(def square)       square    ==   dup *</code></pre>
<p>A derivation using the above axioms and the definition looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>                   2  3  +  square
           ==      5  square                               (+)
           ==      5  dup  *                               (def square)
           ==      5  5  *                                 (dup)
           ==      25                                      (*)</code></pre>
<p>The comments in the right margin explain how a line was obtained from
the previous line. The derivation shows that the expressions in the
first line and the last line denote the same function, or that the
function in the first line is identical with the function in the last
line.</p>
<p>Consider the following equations in infix notation: The first says
that multiplying a number <code>x</code> by 2 gives the same result as
adding it to itself. The second says that the size of a reversed list is
the same as the <code>size</code> of the original list.</p>
<pre><code>        2 * x  =  x + x                 size(reverse(x))  =  size(x)</code></pre>
<p>In Joy the same equations would be written, <em>without
variables</em>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>        2  *   ==   dup  +              reverse  size   ==   size</code></pre>
<p>Other equivalences express algebraic properties of various
operations. For example, the predecessor pred of the successor succ of a
number is just the number itself. The conjunction and of a truth value
with itself gives just the truth value. The less than relation
<code>&lt;</code> is the converse of the greater than relation
<code>&gt;</code>. Inserting a number with cons into a list of numbers
and then taking the sum of that gives the same result as first taking
the sum of the list and then adding the other number. In conventional
notation these are expressed by</p>
<pre><code>        pred(succ(x))  =  x             x and x  =  x
        x &lt; y  =  y &gt; x                 sum(cons(x,y))  =  x + sum(y)</code></pre>
<p>In Joy these are expressed <em>without variables</em></p>
<pre><code>        succ  pred   ==   id            dup  and   ==   id
        &lt;   ==   swap &gt;                 cons  sum   ==   sum  +</code></pre>
<p>Some properties of operations have to be expressed by combinators.
One of these is the dip combinator which expects a program on top of the
stack and below that another value. It saves the value, executes the
program on the remainder of the stack and then restores the saved
value.</p>
<p>In the first example below, the <code>dip</code> combinator is used
to express the associativity of addition. Another combinator is the
<del>app2</del><code>unary2</code> combinator which expects a program on
top of the stack and below that two values. It applies the program to
the two values.</p>
<p>In the second example below it expresses one of the De Morgan laws.
In the third example it expresses that the size of two lists
concatenated is the sum of the <code>size</code>s of the two
concatenands.</p>
<p>The last example uses both combinators to express that multiplication
distributes (from the right) over addition. (Note that the program
parameter for <del>app2</del><code>unary2</code> is first constructed
from the multiplicand and <code>*</code>.)</p>
<pre><code>        [+]  dip  +   ==   +  +
        and  not      ==   [not]  unary2  or        (* app2 *)
        concat  size  ==   [size]  unary2  +        (* app2 *)
        [+]  dip  *   ==   [*]  cons  unary2  +     (* app2 *)</code></pre>
<p>A deep result in the theory of computability concerns the elimination
of recursive definitions. To use the stock example, the
<em>factorial</em> function can be <em>defined</em> recursively in Joy
by</p>
<pre><code>        factorial  ==
            [0 =] [pop 1] [dup 1 - factorial *] ifte</code></pre>
<p>The definition is then <em>used</em> in programs like this:</p>
<pre><code>        5
        factorial</code></pre>
<p>Because in Joy programs can be manipulated as data, the factorial
function can also be computed recursively without a recursive
definition, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>        5
        [ [pop 0 =] [pop pop 1] [[dup 1 -] dip i *] ifte ]
        [dup cons] swap concat dup cons i</code></pre>
<p>The second line in this program does much the same as the body of the
definition of factorial, but it is a quoted program. The third line
first transforms this into another longer quoted program which performs
“anonymous” recursion, and then the final i combinator essentially
dequotes this program causing its execution.</p>
<p>The third line implements Joy’s counterpart of the <em>Y</em>
combinator of the lambda calculus. Exactly the same line can be used to
cause anonymous recursion of other functions which are normally defined
recursively.</p>
<p>Joy has other combinators which make recursive execution of programs
more succinct. (Of course it is also possible in Joy to compute the
factorial function more efficiently with iteration instead of
recursion.)</p>
<p>Since Joy is very different from familiar programming languages, it
takes a while to become used to writing programs in Joy. One way to
start the learning process is by way of writing some simple generally
useful library programs. In an implementation these may be part of an
actual library, or they may be built into the language.</p>
<p>Some general <em>utility program</em>s include operators for
manipulating the Joy stack just below the top element, further operators
for manipulating aggregate values, and a few output programs.</p>
<p>Generally useful are the <em>stack type</em> and the <em>queue
type</em>. Values and operators of these two types are easily
implemented as Joy lists and list operators.</p>
<p>Another collection of useful operators take an aggregate as parameter
and produce a list of subaggregates. These operators are
<em>polymorphic</em> in the sense that the aggregate parameter can be a
(small) set, a string, or a list. One such operator can take a set as
parameter and produces a list of its subsets. All of these operators are
definable without recursion by using the linrec combinator.</p>
<p>Some <em>arithmetic operators</em> are often used to illustrate
recursive definitions, although it is well known that iterative
execution is more efficient. In particular the use of <em>accumulating
parameter</em>s can often replace recursion. This is easily done in Joy
using various iteration combinators.</p>
<p>Values of <em>sequence type</em>s, such as strings and lists, can be
<em>sort</em>ed, and sorted sequences can be <em>merge</em>d. Programs
for doing this are easily written in Joy without recursive definitions
but using appropriate combinators instead.</p>
<p>Joy’s inbuilt datatype of sets is implemented just as bitstrings, and
hence it is limited to small sets of small numbers. The more useful
<em>big set type</em>, which allows large sets of elements of any type,
can be implemented in any language which has lists. It is simple to do
in Joy, and the usual set-theoretic operations are easily provided. A
similar implementation can be used for the <em>dictionary type</em>,
which uses lookup tables for finite functions.</p>
<p>Also useful is the <em>tree type</em>, of lists, or lists of lists,
or lists of lists of lists … of elements other than lists.</p>
<p>A <em>rewriting system</em> consists of a set of syntactic rules for
performing replacements on certain suitable entities. The best known
such system is the one we learnt at school for evaluating arithmetic
expressions. Any programming language can be given a rewriting system,
but for Joy it is particularly simple. The basic binary rewriting
relation will be written in infix notation as “<code>-&gt;</code>”,
pronounced “can be rewritten as”. The following are some sample rules
for the <code>+</code> and <code>&lt;</code> operators and for the dip
combinator.</p>
<pre><code>        2  3  +   -&gt;   5
        2  3  &lt;   -&gt;   true
        a  [P]  dip   -&gt;   P  a</code></pre>
<p>In the last example, <code>P</code> is any program and <code>a</code>
is any literal (such as a number) or a program whose net effect is to
push exactly one item onto the stack. The rewriting relation is extended
to allow rewriting in appropriate contexts, further extended to
accomodate several rewriting steps, and finally extended to become a
congruence relation, an equivalence relation compatible with program
concatenation. This congruence relation between programs is essentially
the same as the identity relation in the algebra of functions which the
programs denote. Although Joy functions take a stack as argument and
value, in the rewrite rules the stack is never mentioned.</p>
<p>The following are rewriting rules for arithmetic expressions in four
different notations: infix, functional, prefix and postfix:</p>
<pre><code>        2 + 3  -&gt;  5                    +(2,3)  -&gt;  5
        + 2 3  -&gt;  5                    2 3 +  -&gt;  5</code></pre>
<p>In each case on the left the operands are <code>2</code> and
<code>3</code>, and the operator or <em>constructor</em> is
<code>+</code>, so they all refer to the same arithmetic term. Since Joy
uses postfix notation, it might be thought that one should attempt a
term rewriting system with rules just like the second one in the last
line. That would treat the short program <code>2 3 +</code> as being
composed of two operands and an operator or constructor. It would also
treat the gap between <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> as quite
different from the gap between <code>3</code> and <code>+</code>. The
difference would be explained away as a syntactic coincidence due to the
choice of notation. Apart from <code>+</code> there would be very many
term constructors.</p>
<p>However, Joy has operators for manipulating the top few elements of
the stack, such as swap, dup and pop. These are also found in the
language <em>Forth</em>. These operators take a stack as argument and
yield a stack as value, and their presence forces all other operators to
be of the same type. For example, the following is a rewrite rule for
swap:</p>
<pre><code>        a  b  swap   -&gt;   b  a</code></pre>
<p>Unlike Forth, Joy also has quotations and combinators. These features
also force the conclusion that the appropriate rewriting system is a
string rewriting system. Consider the following four programs:</p>
<pre><code>        [2] [3 +] b                     [2] [3 +] concat i
        [2 3] [+] b                     [2 3] [+] concat i</code></pre>
<p>They all eventually have to reduce to <code>5</code>, just like the
earlier Joy program <code>2 3 +</code>. It suggests that in the latter
the gaps have to be treated in the same way, the program is a
concatenation of three atomic symbols, and it denotes the composition of
three functions. So, at least for Joy programs without quotations and
combinators, the appropriate system is a string rewriting system. Such a
system is equivalent to a term rewriting system with a <em>concatenation
constructor</em> for programs as the only constructor. To handle
combinators, a <em>quotation constructor</em> has to be introduced as a
second constructor.</p>
<p>The best known functional languages are the <em>lambda calculus</em>
and, based on it, the programming languages LISP and its descendants.
All of them rely heavily on two operations, abstraction and application,
which are in some sense inverses of each other. Abstraction binds free
variables in an expression, and it yields a function which is a first
class value.</p>
<p>The bound variables are the formal parameters of the function, and,
importantly, they are named. Application of an abstracted function to
some actual parameters can be understood as resulting in a substitution
of actual for formal parameters and then evaluation of the modified
expression. More efficiently application can be implemented using an
<em>environment</em> of name-value pairs. The lambda calculus does not
need definitions, but all functional programming languages allow them as
a matter of convenience. Definitions also use named formal parameters,
and in applications these have to be substituted or an environment has
to be maintained.</p>
<p>Two other functional languages are the <em>combinatory logic</em> of
Curry and the <em>FP</em> language of Backus. They are not based on the
lambda calculus, they eliminate abstraction completely and hence do not
have to deal with substitution and environments. As a result these
languages can be manipulated using simple algebraic techniques. But like
the lambda calculus and the languages derived from it, both are based on
the application of functions to arguments. However, application does not
have attractive algebraic properties, and hence there is no theoretical
reason for preferring one concrete notation over another.</p>
<p>The languages of <em>category</em> theory comprises another group of
functional languages. Whereas the other functional languages use
function application, these use function composition. No high level
programming language has been based on this formalism, but it has been
used as a low level machine language as a target for compilation from a
(typed) lambda calculus source. Joy is a high level programming language
which resembles the categorical languages more than it resembles any of
the other functional languages.</p>
<p>The prototype implementation is written in (K&amp;R) C; it uses a
simple stop-copy heap management.</p>
