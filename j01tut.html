<p>Revised February 2003<br />
This revision includes references to John Cowan’s (2001) extension.</p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> Joy is a functional programming language which is
not based on the application of functions to arguments but on the
composition of functions. It does not use lambda-abstraction of
expressions but instead it uses quotation of expressions. A large number
of what are called combinators are used to perform dequotation, they
have the effect of higher order functions. Several of them can be used
to eliminate recursive definitions. Programs in Joy are compact and
often look just like postfix notation. Writing programs and reasoning
about them is made easy because there is no substitution of actual for
formal parameters.</p>
<p>This tutorial describes basic features of the language Joy which are
likely to be the same in all implementations.</p>
<p><em>Keywords:</em> functional programming, higher order functions,
composition of functions, combinators, elimination of recursive
definitions, variable free notation</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Although the theory of Joy is of interest, this tutorial exposition
avoids theory as much as possible.</p>
<p>The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: This
introductory section continues with a very short outline of some
distinguishing features of the language. The next two sections introduce
the basic data types and operations on them. The section after that
returns to the central feature of Joy: quotations of programs and their
use with combinators. After a short section on definitions the next
section resumes the discussion of combinators, in particular those that
can eliminate the need for recursive definitions. In the final section
several short programs and one larger program are used to illustrate
programming with aggregates in Joy.</p>
<p>To add two integers, say 2 and 3, and to write their sum, you type
the program</p>
<pre><code>        2  3  +</code></pre>
<p>This is ordinary postfix notation, a reverse form of a notation first
used by Polish logicians in the 1920s. Its advantage is that in complex
expressions no parentheses are needed. Internally it works like this:
the first numeral causes the integer 2 to be pushed onto a stack. The
second numeral causes the integer 3 to be pushed on top of that. Then
the addition operator pops the two integers off the stack and pushes
their sum, 5. The system reads inputs like the above and executes them
when they are terminated by a period <code>"."</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>        2  3  + .</code></pre>
<p>In the default mode there is no need for an explicit output
instruction, so the numeral <code>5</code> is now written to the output
file which normally is the screen. So, in the default mode the
terminating <code>"."</code> may be taken to be an instruction to write
the top element of the stack. In what follows the terminating period
will not be shown any further.</p>
<p>Apart from integers, the current version of Joy as extended by John
Cowan has real numbers or “floats”. Arithmetic operations on floats are
just like those on integers. The following multiplies two numbers</p>
<pre><code>        2.34  5.67  *</code></pre>
<p>and leaves their product, <code>13.2678</code>, on top of the stack.
(So, to see the result on the terminal, the above line has to terminated
by a period.)</p>
<p>To compute the square of an integer, it has to be multiplied by
itself. To compute the square of the sum of two integers, the sum has to
be multiplied by itself. Preferably this should be done without
computing the sum twice. The following is a program to compute the
square of the sum of 2 and 3:</p>
<pre><code>        2  3  +  dup  *</code></pre>
<p>After the sum of 2 and 3 has been computed, the stack just contains
the integer 5. The dup operator then pushes another copy of the 5 onto
the stack. Then the multiplication operator replaces the two integers by
their product, which is the square of 5. The square is then written out
as 25. Apart from the <code>dup</code> operator there are several others
for re-arranging the top of the stack. The pop operator removes the top
element, and the swap operator interchanges the top two elements. This
is quite different from proper postfix notation, because the stack
manipulators only make sense in the presence of a stack. Such notation
is also used in some pocket calculators, the Unix utility dc, the
typesetting language Postscript and the general purpose language Forth.
Billy Tanksley has suggested that this be called concatenative notation.
The theory of this notation is a topic unto itself, but it will not be
dealt with in this tutorial.</p>
<p>A <em>list</em> of integers is written inside square brackets. Just
as integers can be added and otherwise manipulated, so lists can be
manipulated in various ways. The following concatenates two lists:</p>
<pre><code>        [1 2 3]  [4 5 6 7]  concat</code></pre>
<p>The two lists are first pushed onto the stack. Then the
<code>concat</code> operator pops them off the stack and pushes the list
<code>[1 2 3 4 5 6 7]</code> onto the stack. There it may be further
manipulated or it may be written to the output file.</p>
<p>The elements of a list need not be all of the same type, and the
elements can be lists themselves. The following uses a list containing
one integer, two floats and one list of three integers.</p>
<pre><code>        [ 3.14  42  [1 2 3]  0.003 ]   dup  concat</code></pre>
<p>The dup operator will push a copy of the list on top of the stack,
where the two lists will then be concatenated into one.</p>
<p>Joy makes extensive use of <em>combinator</em>s. These are like
operators in that they expect something specific on top of the stack.
But unlike operators they execute what they find on top of the stack,
and this has to be the <em>quotation</em> of a program, enclosed in
square brackets. One of these is a combinator for mapping elements of
one list via a function to another list. Consider the program</p>
<pre><code>        [1 2 3 4]  [dup *]  map</code></pre>
<p>It first pushes the list of integers and then the quoted program onto
the stack. The <code>map</code> combinator then removes the list and the
quotation and constructs another list by applying the program to each
member of the given list. The result is the list <code>[1 4 9 16]</code>
which is left on top of the stack.</p>
<p>In <em>definition</em>s of new functions no formal parameters are
used, and hence there is no substitution of actual parameters for formal
parameters. After the following definition</p>
<pre><code>        square   ==   dup  *</code></pre>
<p>the symbol <code>square</code> can be used in place of
<code>dup *</code>.</p>
<p>Definitions occur in blocks such as the following:</p>
<pre><code>    DEFINE
        square  ==  dup * ;
        cube    ==  dup dup * * .</code></pre>
<p>As the example shows, definition mode is initiated by the reserved
word <code>DEFINE</code> and extends to the period. Individual
definitions are separated by semicolons. In libraries the initiator
<code>LIBRA</code> is used instead of <code>DEFINE</code>. In the
remainder of this paper the initiator, the separator and the terminator
will generally not be shown any further.</p>
<p>As in other programming languages, definitions may be recursive, for
example in the definition of the factorial function. That definition
uses a certain recursive pattern that is useful elsewhere. In Joy there
is a combinator for <em>primitive recursion</em> which has this pattern
built in and thus avoids the need for a definition. The primrec
combinator expects two quoted programs in addition to a data parameter.
For an integer data parameter it works like this: If the data parameter
is zero, then the first quotation has to produce the value to be
returned. If the data parameter is positive then the second has to
combine the data parameter with the result of applying the function to
its predecessor. For the factorial function the required quoted programs
are very simple:</p>
<pre><code>        [1]  [*]  primrec</code></pre>
<p>computes the factorial recursively. There is no need for any
definition. For example, the following program computes the factorial of
<code>5</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        5  [1]  [*]  primrec</code></pre>
<p>It first pushes the number <code>5</code> and then it pushes the two
short quoted programs. At this point the stack contains three elements.
Then the <code>primrec</code> combinator is executed. It pops the two
quotations off the stack and saves them elsewhere. Then
<code>primrec</code> tests whether the top element on the stack
(initially the <code>5</code>) is equal to zero. If it is, it pops it
off and executes one of the quotations, the <code>[1]</code> which
leaves <code>1</code> on the stack as the result. Otherwise it pushes a
decremented copy of the top element and recurses. On the way back from
the recursion it uses the other quotation, <code>[*]</code>, to multiply
what is now a factorial on top of the stack by the second element on the
stack. When all is done, the stack contains <code>120</code>, the
factorial of <code>5</code>.</p>
<p>As may be seen from this program, the usual branching of recursive
definitions is built into the combinator. The <code>primrec</code>
combinator can be used with many other quotation parameters to compute
quite different functions. It can also be used with data types other
than integers.</p>
<p>Joy has many more combinators which can be used to calculate many
functions without forcing the user to give recursive or non-recursive
definitions. Some of the combinators are more data-specific than
<code>primrec</code>, and others are far more general.</p>
<h2 id="integers-floats-characters-and-truth-values">Integers, floats,
characters and truth values</h2>
<p>The data types of Joy are divided into simple and aggregate types.
The <em>simple</em> types comprise integers, floats (or reals),
characters and the truth values. The aggregate types comprise sets,
strings and lists. Literals of any type cause a value of that type to be
pushed onto the stack. There they can be manipulated by the general
stack operations such as dup, pop and swap and a few others, or they can
be manipulated by operators specific to their type. This section
introduces literals and operators of the simple types.</p>
<p>An <em>integer</em> is just a whole number. Literals of this type are
written in decimal notation. The following binary operations are
provided:</p>
<pre><code>        +        -        *        /        rem</code></pre>
<p>The first four have their conventional meaning, the last is the
operator for the remainder after division. Operators are written after
their operands. Binary operators remove two values from the top of the
stack and replace them by the result. For example, the program</p>
<pre><code>        20  3  4  +  *  6  -  100  rem</code></pre>
<p>evaluates to 34, and this value is left on top of the stack. There
are also some unary operators specific to integers like the abs operator
which takes the absolute value, and the signum operator which yields
<code>-1</code>, <code>0</code> or <code>+1</code>, depending on whether
its parameter is negative, zero or positive.</p>
<p>Apart from the positive and negative integers or whole numbers, Joy
has floating point numbers or “floats”. Literals of this type are
written with a decimal point and at least one digit after that.
Optionally the last digit may be followed by ‘E’ or ‘e’ and then a
positive or negative exponent. Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code>        3.14     314.0     3.14E5    3.14e-5</code></pre>
<p>The last two are equivalent to 314000.0 and 0.0000314 . Most
operators on integers work in the same way for floats. John Cowan’s
extension also provides a large number of functions for floats, but
these are outside the scope of this tutorial.</p>
<p>A <em>character</em> is a letter, a digit, a punctuation character,
in fact any printable character or one of a few white space characters.
Literals of type character are written as a single quote followed by the
character itself. Values of type character are treated very much like
small numbers. That means that other numbers can be added to them, for
example 32 to change letter from upper case to lower case. There are two
unary operators which are defined on characters and on integers: pred
takes the predecessor, succ takes the successor. For example,</p>
<pre><code>        &#39;A  32  +  succ  succ</code></pre>
<p>evaluates to <code>'c</code>, the third lower case letter.</p>
<p>The type of <em>truth value</em>s is what in some languages is called
<em>Boolean</em>. The following are the two literals, the unary negation
operator and two binary operators for conjunction and disjunction:</p>
<pre><code>        true        false        not        and        or</code></pre>
<p>For example, the program</p>
<pre><code>        false  true  false  not  and  not  or</code></pre>
<p>evaluates to <code>false</code>.</p>
<p>Values of type integer and character can be compared using the
following <em>relational operator</em>s:</p>
<pre><code>        =        &lt;        &gt;        !=        &lt;=        &gt;=</code></pre>
<p>The != operator returns the negation of what the = operator returns.
The others have the conventional meaning. As all operators, they are
written in postfix notation. The result is always a truth value. For
example,</p>
<pre><code>        &#39;A  &#39;E  &lt;  2  3  +  15  3  /  =  and</code></pre>
<p>evaluates to <code>true</code>.</p>
<h2 id="sets-strings-and-lists">Sets, strings and lists</h2>
<p>The <em>aggregate</em> types are the unordered type of sets and the
ordered types of strings and lists. Aggregates can be built up,
combined, taken apart and tested for membership. This section introduces
literals and operators of the aggregate types.</p>
<p>A <em>set</em> is an unordered collection of zero or more small
integers. Literals of type set are written inside curly braces, and the
empty set is written as an empty pair of braces. For set literals the
ordering of the elements is irrelevant and duplication has no effect.
The operators for conjunction and disjunction are also defined on sets.
For example, the two equivalent programs</p>
<pre><code>        {1 3 5 7}  {2 4 6 8}  or  {}  or  {3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10}  and
        {3 7 5 1}  {2 4 6 8}  or  {}  or  {3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10} and</code></pre>
<p>evaluate to <code>{3 4 5 6 7 8}</code>. The negation operator not
takes complements relative to the largest expressible set, which in most
implementations will have a maximum of 32 members: from <code>0</code>
to <code>31</code>.</p>
<p>A <em>string</em> is an ordered sequence of zero or more characters.
Literals of this type string are written inside double quotes, and the
empty string is written as two adjacent double quotes with nothing
inside: <code>""</code>. Note that this is different from the string
containing just the blank: <code>" "</code>. Two strings can be
concatenated, and a string can be reversed. For example,</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;dooG&quot;  reverse  &quot; morning&quot;  &quot; &quot;  concat concat  &quot;world&quot;  concat</code></pre>
<p>evaluates to <code>"Good morning world"</code>.</p>
<p>For many operators an implementation can choose whether to make it a
primitive or define it in a library. Apart from execution speed, to the
user it makes no difference as to which choice has been made. In the
current implementation the <code>reverse</code> operator is defined in a
library.</p>
<p>A <em>list</em> is an ordered sequence of zero or more values of any
type. Literals of type list are written inside square brackets, the
empty list is written as an empty pair of brackets. Lists can contain
lists as members, so the type of lists is a recursive data type.</p>
<p>Values of the aggregate types, namely sets, strings and lists can be
constructed from existing ones by adding a new member with the cons
operator. This is a binary operator for which the first parameter must
be a possible new member and the second parameter must be an aggregate.
For sets the new member is added if it is not already there, and for
strings and lists the new member is added in front. Here are some
examples. The programs on the left evaluate to the literals on the
right.</p>
<pre><code>        5  3 {2 1}  cons  cons  3  swap  cons                {1 2 3 5}
        &#39;E  &#39;C  &quot;AB&quot;  cons  cons  &#39;C  swap  cons               &quot;CECAB&quot;
        5  [6]  [1 2]  cons  cons  &#39;A  swap  cons       [&#39;A 5 [6] 1 2]</code></pre>
<p>As the examples show, the <code>cons</code> operator is most useful
for adding elements into an aggregate which is already on the stack
below the aggregate. To add new elements that have just been pushed, the
new elements and the aggregate have to be <code>swap</code>ped first
before the new element can be <code>cons</code>ed into the aggregate. To
facilitate this, Joy has another operator, swons, which first performs a
<code>swap</code> and then a <code>cons</code>.</p>
<p>Whereas the <code>cons</code> and <code>swons</code> operators builds
up aggregate values, the two unary operators first and rest take them
apart. Both are defined only on non-empty aggregate values. For the two
ordered aggregate types, strings and lists, the meaning is obvious: the
first operator returns the first element and the rest operator returns
the string or list without the first element:</p>
<pre><code>        &quot;CECAB&quot;  first                                              &#39;C
        &quot;CECEB&quot;  rest                                           &quot;ECAB&quot;
        [&#39;A 5 [6] 1 2]  first                                       &#39;A
        [&#39;A 5 [6] 1 2]  rest                               [5 [6] 1 2]</code></pre>
<p>But sets are unordered, so it does not make sense to speak of their
first members <em>as sets</em>. But since their members are integers,
the ordering on the integers can be used to determine what the first
member is. Analogous considerations apply to the <code>rest</code>
operator.</p>
<pre><code>        {5 2 3}  first                                                2
        {5 2 3}  rest                                             {3 5}</code></pre>
<p>For all three types of aggregates the members other than the first
can be extracted by repeatedly taking the rest and finally the first of
that. This can be cumbersome for extracting member deep inside. An
alternative is to use the at operator to <em>index</em> into the
aggregate, by extracting a member <strong>at</strong> a numerically
specified position. For example, the following are two equivalent
programs to extract the fifth member of any aggregate:</p>
<pre><code>        rest  rest  rest  rest  first
        5  at</code></pre>
<p>There is a unary operator which determines the size of any aggregate
value. For sets this is the number of members, for strings its is the
length, and for lists it is the length counting only top level members.
The <code>size</code> operator yields zero for empty aggregates and a
positive integer for others. There is also a unary null operator, a
predicate which yields the truth value <code>true</code> for empty
aggregates and <code>false</code> for others. Another predicate, the
small operator, yields <code>true</code> just in case the size is
<code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Apart from the operators which only affect the stack, there are two
for explicit input and output. The get operator reads an item from the
input file and pushes it onto the stack. The put operator pops an item
off the stack and writes it to the screen or whatever the output file
is. The next program reads two pairs of integers and then compares the
sum of the first pair with the sum of the second pair.</p>
<pre><code>        get  get  +  get  get  +  &gt;  put</code></pre>
<p>The two get operators attempt to read two items and push them onto
the stack. There they are immediately added, so they have to be
integers. This is repeated for the second pair. At this point the stack
contains the two sums. Then the comparison operator pops the two
integers and replaces them by a truth value, true or false, depending on
whether the first sum is less than the second sum. The put operator pops
that truth value and writes it. The stack is now as it was before the
program was run, only the input file and the output file are
changed.</p>
<p>For another example, the following conducts a silly little
dialogue:</p>
<pre><code>        &quot;What is your name?&quot; put &quot;Hello, &quot; get concat put</code></pre>
<p>First the question string is pushed on the stack and then popped to
be written out to the screen. Then the <code>'"Hello, "'</code> string
is pushed. Next, the <code>get</code> operator reads an item from the
keyboard and pushes it onto the stack. That item has to be another
string, because it will be concatenated with what is below it on the
stack. The resultant string is then written out. So, if in answer to the
question a user types <code>'"Pat"'</code>, the program finally writes
out <code>'"Hello, Pat"'</code>.</p>
<p>In addition to the compound data types set, string and list, John
Cowan’s extension provides a large number of operators for manipulating
the file system: opening, closing, deleting files, and various
input-output operators. These are outside the scope of this
tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="quotations-and-combinators">Quotations and Combinators</h2>
<p>Lists are really just a special case of <em>quoted program</em>s.
Lists only contain values of the various types, but quoted programs may
contain other elements such as operators and some others that are
explained below. A <em>quotation</em> can be treated as passive data
structure just like a list. For example,</p>
<pre><code>        [ +  20  *  10  4  - ]</code></pre>
<p>has size <code>6</code>, its second and third elements are
<code>20</code> and <code>*</code>, it can be reversed or it can be
concatenated with other quotations. But passive quotations can also be
made active by <em>dequotation</em>.</p>
<p>If the above quotation occurs in a program, then it results in the
quotation being pushed onto the stack - just as a list would be pushed.
There are many other ways in which that quotation could end up on top of
the stack, by being concatenated from its parts, by extraction from a
larger quotation, or by being read from the input. No matter how it got
to be on top of the stack, it can now be treated in two ways: passively
as a data structure, or actively as a program. The square brackets
prevented it from being treated actively. Without them the program would
have been executed: it would expect two integers which it would add,
then multiply the result by 20, and finally push 6, the difference
between 10 and 4.</p>
<p>Joy has certain devices called <em>combinator</em>s which cause the
execution of quoted programs that are on top of the stack. This section
describes only a very small proportion of them.</p>
<p>One of the simplest is the i combinator. Its effect is to execute a
single program on top of the stack, and nothing else. Syntactically
speaking, its effect is to remove the quoting square brackets and thus
to expose the quoted program for execution. Consequently the following
two programs are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>        [ +  20  *  10  4  - ]  i
          +  20  *  10  4  -</code></pre>
<p>The <code>i</code> combinator is mainly of theoretical significance,
but it is used occasionally. The many other combinators are essential
for programming in Joy.</p>
<p>One of the most well-known combinators is for branching. The ifte
combinator expects three quoted programs on the stack, an if-part, a
then-part and an else-part, in that order, with the else-part on top.
The <code>ifte</code> combinator removes and saves the three quotations
and then performs the following on the remainder of the stack: It
executes the if-part which should leave a truth value on top of the
stack. That truth value is saved and the stack is restored to what it
was before the execution of the if-part. Then, if the saved truth value
was <code>true</code>, the <code>ifte</code> combinator executes the
then-part, otherwise it executes the else-part.</p>
<p>In most cases the three parts would have been pushed in that order
just before the <code>ifte</code> combinator is executed. But any or all
of the three parts could have been constructed from other
quotations.</p>
<p>In the following example the three parts are pushed just before the
<code>ifte</code> combinator is executed. The program looks at a number
on top of the stack, and if it is greater than 1000 it will halve it,
otherwise it will triple it.</p>
<pre><code>        [1000 &gt;]  [2 /]  [3 *]  ifte</code></pre>
<p>Some combinators require that the stack contains values of certain
types. Many are analogues of higher order functions familiar from other
programming languages: map, filter and fold. Others only make sense in
Joy. For example, the step combinator can be used to access all elements
of an aggregate in sequence. For strings and lists this means the order
of their occurrence, for sets it means the underlying order. The
following will <code>step</code> through the members of the second list
and <code>swons</code> them into the initially empty first list. The
effect is to reverse the non-empty list, yielding
<code>[5 6 3 8 2]</code>.</p>
<pre><code>        []  [2 8 3 6 5]  [swons]  step</code></pre>
<p>The map combinator expects an aggregate value on top of the stack,
and it yields another aggregate of the same size. The elements of the
new aggregate are computed by applying the quoted program to each
element of the original aggregate. An example was already given in the
introduction.</p>
<p>Another combinator that expects an aggregate is the filter
combinator. The quoted program has to yield a truth value. The result is
a new aggregate of the same type containing those elements of the
original for which the quoted program yields <code>true</code>. For
example, the quoted program <code>['Z &gt;]</code> will yield truth for
characters whose numeric values is greater than that of <code>Z</code>.
Hence it can be used to remove upper case letters and blanks from a
string. So the following evaluates to <code>"ohnmith"</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        &quot;John Smith&quot;   [&#39;Z &gt;]   filter</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to add or multiply or otherwise combine all
elements of an aggregate value. The fold combinator can do just that. It
requires three parameters: the aggregate to be folded, the quoted value
to be returned when the aggregate is empty, and the quoted binary
operation to be used to combine the elements. In some languages the
combinator is called reduce (because it turns the aggregate into a
single value), or insert (because it looks as though the binary
operation has been inserted between any two members). The following two
programs compute the sum of the members of a list and the sum of the
squares of the members of a list. They evaluate to 10 and 38,
respectively.</p>
<pre><code>        [2 5 3]  0  [+]  fold
        [2 5 3]  0  [dup * +]  fold</code></pre>
<p>To compute the average or arithmetic mean of the members of a set or
a list, we have to divide the sum by the size. (Because of the integer
arithmetic, the division will produce an inaccurate average.) The
aggregate needs to be looked at twice: once for the sum and once for the
size. So one way to compute the average is to duplicate the aggregate
value first with the dup operator. Then take the <code>sum</code> of the
top version. Then use the swap operator to interchange the position of
the sum and the original aggregate, so that the original is now on top
of the stack. Take the size of that. Now the stack contains the sum and
the size, with the size on top. Apply the division operator to obtain
the average value.</p>
<pre><code>        dup  0  [+]  fold  swap  size  /</code></pre>
<p>One nice feature of this little program is that it works equally for
set values as for list values. This is because the constituents
<code>fold</code> and <code>size</code> work for both types.</p>
<p>But there are two aspects of this program which are unsatisfactory.
One concerns the <code>dup</code> and <code>swap</code> operators which
make the program hard to read. The other concerns the sequencing of
operations: The program causes the computation of the sum to occur
before the computation of the size. But it does not matter in which
order they are computed, in fact on a machine with several processors
the sum and the size could be computed in parallel. Joy has a combinator
which addresses this problem: there is one <strong>one</strong> data
parameters, the aggregate, which is to be fed to <strong>two</strong>
functions. From each of the functions a value is to be
<strong>constr</strong>ucted. Because of the one datum and the two
functions, the combinator is called
<del>constr12</del><code>construct</code>. The program for the average
looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>        [0 [+] fold]   [size]   construct   /   (* constr12 *)</code></pre>
<p>There are several similar combinators with different combinations of
trailing digits.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>In conventional languages the definition of a function of one or more
arguments has to name these as formal parameters <code>x</code>,
<code>y</code> … For example, the squaring function might be defined by
some variation of any of the following:</p>
<pre><code>        square(x)  =  x * x
        (defun (square x)  (* x x))
        square  =  lambda x.x * x</code></pre>
<p>In Joy formal parameters such as <code>x</code> above are not
required, a definition of the squaring function is simply</p>
<pre><code>        square   ==   dup  *</code></pre>
<p>This is one of the principal differences between Joy and those
languages that are based on the lambda calculus. The latter include (the
purely functional subsets of) Lisp, Scheme, ML and Haskell. All of these
are based on the application of functions to arguments or actual
parameters.</p>
<p>In definitions and abstractions of functions the formal parameters
have to be named - <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and so on, or
something more informative. This is different in Joy. It is based on the
composition of functions and not on the application of functions to
arguments. In definitions and abstractions of functions the arguments do
not need to be named and as formal parameters indeed cannot be named.
One consequence is that there are no <em>environment</em>s of name-value
pairs. Instead the work of environments is done by higher order
functions called combinators.</p>
<p>Finally, the concrete syntax of the language is an integral part of
the language and aids in reasoning about Joy programs in the
metalanguage.</p>
<p>Suppose it is required to transform a list of numbers into the list
of their cubes. The cube of a single number is of course computed by</p>
<pre><code>        dup  dup  *  *</code></pre>
<p>It would be possible to introduce a definition of the cube function.
But that would introduce another name, <code>cube</code>. If the cube
function is used only once for computing the cubes of a list of numbers,
then it may not be desirable to give a definition of it at all. In Joy
the list of cubes is computed by the first line below, but it is also
possible to give an explicit definition as in the second line.</p>
<pre><code>        [dup dup * *]  map
        cubelist   ==   [dup dup * *] map</code></pre>
<p>In a language that is based on the lambda calculus both would need a
lambda abstraction with a variable, say <code>x</code>, for the number
to be cubed. And of course the second line would need an additional
formal parameter, say <code>l</code>, or a lambda abstraction with a
variable <code>l</code> for the list to which the cubelist function is
to be applied.</p>
<p>Suppose now that it is required to transform a <em>list of lists</em>
of numbers into the <em>list of lists</em> of their cubes. One might
give the definition</p>
<pre><code>        cubelistlist   ==   [ [dup dup * *] map ]  map</code></pre>
<p>Of course, if that function is only to be used once, one might not
bother to give a definition at all but use the right hand side directly.
In languages based on abstraction, at least two formal parameters are
needed just for the right hand side, and another for the definition
itself. For example, in Scheme the definition looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>        (define (cubelistlist ll)
                (map (lambda (l)
                     (map (lambda (n) (* n (* n n)))
                           l ) )
                 ll )</code></pre>
<p>Here the two formal parameters are <code>n</code> for the number and
<code>l</code> for the list of numbers on the right hand side, and
<code>ll</code> for the list of lists of numbers in the definition
itself.</p>
<p>As in other languages, definitions can be recursive in Joy. In the
first line below is a recursive definition of the factorial function in
one of many variants of conventional notation. In the second line is a
recursive definition in Joy.</p>
<pre><code>        factorial(x)  =  if x = 0 then 1 else x * factorial(x - 1)
        factorial  ==  [0 =] [pop 1] [dup 1 - factorial *] ifte</code></pre>
<p>Again the Joy version does not use a formal parameter <code>x</code>.
It works like this: The definition uses the ifte combinator immediately
after the if-part, the then-part and the else-part have been pushed.</p>
<p>The <code>ifte</code> combinator then does this: it executes the
if-part, in this case <code>[0 =]</code>, which tests whether the
(anonymous) integer parameter is equal to zero. If it is, then the
if-part is executed, in this case <code>[pop 1]</code>, which pops the
parameter off the stack and replaces it by one. Otherwise the else-part
is executed, in this case <code>[dup 1 - factorial *]</code>. This uses
<code>dup</code> to make another copy of the parameter and subtracts one
from the copy. Then the <code>factorial</code> function is called
recursively on that. Finally the original parameter and the just
computed factorial are multiplied.</p>
<p>The definition could be shortened and made a little more efficient by
using the inbuilt predicate null which tests for zero and the pred
operator which takes the predecessor of a number. But these changes are
insignificant.</p>
<p>For more complex functions of several arguments it is necessary to be
able to access the arguments anywhere in the definition. Joy avoids
formal parameters altogether, and hence in general arbitrary access has
to be done by mechanisms more sophisticated than <code>dup</code>,
<code>swap</code> and <code>pop</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some more definitions that one might have:</p>
<pre><code>        sum   ==   0  [+]  fold
        product   ==   1  [*]  fold
        average   ==   [sum]  [size]  construct  /  (* constr12 *)
        concatenation   ==   &quot;&quot;  [concat]  fold</code></pre>
<p>The last definition is for an operator which yields a single string
which is the concatenation of a list of strings.</p>
<h2 id="recursive-combinators">Recursive Combinators</h2>
<p>If one wanted to compute the list of factorials of a given list, this
could be done by</p>
<pre><code>        [ factorial ]  map</code></pre>
<p>But this relies on an external definition of factorial. It was
necessary to give that definition explicitly because it is recursive. If
one only wanted to compute factorials of lists of numbers, then it would
be a minor nuisance to be forced to define factorial explicitly just
because the definition is recursive.</p>
<p>A high proportion of recursively defined functions exhibit a very
simple pattern: There is some test, the if-part, which determines
whether the ground case obtains. If it does, then the non-recursive
then-part is executed. Otherwise the recursive else-part has to be
executed. In the else-part there is only <em>one</em> recursive call,
and there can be something before the recursive call and something after
the recursive call. It helps to think of the else-part to have two
components, the else1-part before the recursive call, and the else2-part
after the recursive call. This pattern is called <em>linear
recursion</em>, and it occurs very frequently.</p>
<p>Joy has a useful device, the linrec combinator, which allows
computation of anonymous functions that <em>might</em> have been defined
recursively using a linear recursive pattern. Whereas the
<code>ifte</code> combinator requires three quoted parameters, the
<code>linrec</code> combinator requires four: an if-part, a then-part,
an else1-part and an else2-part. For example, the factorial function
could be computed by</p>
<pre><code>        [null]  [succ]  [dup pred]  [*]  linrec</code></pre>
<p>There is no need for a definition, the above program can be used
directly.</p>
<p>Very frequently the if-part of a linear recursion tests for a simple
base condition which depends on the type of the parameter. For numbers
that condition tends to be being zero, for sets, strings and lists that
condition tends to be being empty. The else1-part frequently makes the
parameter smaller in some way. For numbers it decrements them, for sets,
strings and lists it takes the rest.</p>
<p>Joy has another useful combinator which has the appropriate if-part
and else1-part built in. This is the primrec combinator, which only has
to be supplied with two quotation parameters, the (modified) then-part
and the else2-part of linear recursion. For the factorial function the
two quotation parameters are very simple:</p>
<pre><code>        [1]  [*]  primrec</code></pre>
<p>computes the factorial function. So, if one wanted to compute the
list of factorial of a given list of numbers this can be done by either
of the following:</p>
<pre><code>        [ [null]  [succ]  [dup pred]  [*]  linrec ]   map
        [ [1]  [*]  primrec ]   map</code></pre>
<p>The factorial of a number is the product of successive natural
numbers up to the actual parameter. The following compute instead their
sums and the sum of their squares:</p>
<pre><code>        [0]  [+]  primrec
        [0]  [dup * +]  primrec</code></pre>
<p>Many of the Joy combinators are polymorphic in the sense that they
can be applied to parameters of quite different types. The combinator
<code>primrec</code> can be applied not only to numbers but also to
lists. For example, applied to the list <code>[1 2 3]</code> the
program</p>
<pre><code>        [[]]  [[] cons cons]  primrec</code></pre>
<p>produces the list <code>[1 [2 [3 []]]]</code>. Lisp programmers will
recognise a similarity to “dotted pairs”. In the following, the first
turns a set of numbers into a list, the second turns a list of numbers
into a set:</p>
<pre><code>        [[]]  [cons]  primrec
        [{}]  [cons]  primrec</code></pre>
<p>In fact, the first can also be applied to a list and the second can
also be applied to a set. But in that case they just compute the
identity. They can even be applied to numbers - and then they produce a
list or a set of numbers from the parameter down to 1.</p>
<p>In many recursive definitions there are two recursive calls of the
function being defined. This is the pattern of <em>binary
recursion</em>, and it is used in the usual definitions of quicksort and
of the Fibonacci function. Joy has a facility that eliminates the need
for a recursive definition, the binrec combinator.</p>
<p>The following will <em>quicksort</em> a list whose members can be a
mixture of anything except lists. The program easily fits onto one line,
but for reference it is here written over several numbered lines:</p>
<pre><code>    1           [small]
    2           []
    3           [uncons [&gt;] split]
    4           [[swap] dip cons concat]
    5           binrec</code></pre>
<p>This is how it works: Lines 1..4 each push a quoted program. In line
5 the <code>binrec</code> combinator is called, and it will make use of
the four quoted programs and below that the list to be sorted. The four
quoted programs are saved elsewhere, and the <code>binrec</code>
combinator begins by executing the program from line 1. This tests
whether the list to be sorted is small, i.e. has at most one member. If
indeed it is small, then it is sorted already.</p>
<p>The <code>binrec</code> combinator now executes the program from line
2, which does nothing and hence leaves the small list as it is. On the
other hand, if the list is not small, then the programs in lines 3 and 4
will be executed. The program in line 3 removes the first element from
the list and uses it as a pivot to split the rest of the list into two
sublists, by using the comparison function in <code>[&gt;]</code> and
the <code>split</code> combinator.</p>
<p>At this point the <code>binrec</code> combinator calls itself
recursively on the two sublists and sorts them both. Finally the program
in line 4 combines the two sorted versions and the original pivot into a
single sorted list. The three items are not quite in the required order,
so the <code>[swap] dip</code> part puts the pivot in between the two
sorted lists.</p>
<p>Then <code>cons</code> puts the pivot in front of the topmost string
or list, and finally <code>concat</code> combines everything into one
single sorted list. Since all operations in the program also work on
strings, the program itself can equally well be used to sort a
string.</p>
<p>In fact, the program can be used on sets too, but this of course is
pointless. The program is useful, it is part of the Joy system library
under the name of qsort.</p>
<p>Many other functions are often defined by recursive definitions that
use binary recursion. In Joy they can all be computed with the
<code>binrec</code> combinator without the need for a definition. For
example, the following computes the <em>Fibonacci</em> function; it
implements the usual inefficient algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>        [small]  []  [pred dup pred]  [+]  binrec</code></pre>
<p>The system library of course contains the well known efficient
algorithm.</p>
<p>There are only a few second order combinators, ones which require a
first order combinator as parameter. One of them is treerec for
recursing through <em>tree</em>s. These are either anything but a list,
or lists of trees. For example, in the following <code>treerec</code> is
given <code>[map]</code> as a parameter, which in turn will be given
<code>[dup *]</code> as a parameter when <code>treerec</code> encounters
a list. The function to be applied to numbers possibly deeply embedded
within lists is the squaring function <code>[dup *]</code>.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>        [ 1 [2 3] [[[4]]] 5 ]  [dup *]  [map]  treerec</code></pre>
<p>produce</p>
<pre><code>        [ 1 [2 9] [[[16]]] 25 ]</code></pre>
<p>All of these combinators can be defined in other functional
languages, but they are less useful there. This is because their
parameters have to be abstractions with variables, and not quotations as
in Joy.</p>
<h2 id="programming-with-aggregates">Programming with aggregates</h2>
<p>The <em>aggregate</em> types of Joy are lists, sets and strings.
There are several unary operators which take an aggregate as parameter
and produce as value a list of subaggregates. One of these is the
powerlist operator. For an aggregate of size <code>N</code> it produces
a list of all the <embed
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?2%5EN" /> subaggregates.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>        [1 2 3]  powerlist</code></pre>
<p>produces as result</p>
<pre><code>        [ [1 2 3] [1 2] [1 3] [1] [2 3] [2] [3] [] ]</code></pre>
<p>If the ordering does not suit, the result list can always be
rearranged, for example it can be reversed. For another example, one can
sort the list according to size. The mk_qsort combinator expects an
aggregate and a quoted operator as parameters and it applies the
operator to each member of the aggregate to use as the basis for sorting
them.</p>
<pre><code>        [1 2 3]  powerlist  [size]  mk_qsort</code></pre>
<p>produces as a result</p>
<pre><code>        [ [] [1] [2] [3] [1 2] [1 3] [2 3] [1 2 3] ]</code></pre>
<p>The powerlist operators can also be applied to a string. The result
is a list of all substrings. In the following the result list is
filtered to retain only those substrings whose size is greater than 3.
This is achieved by the filter combinator which expects an aggregate and
a quoted predicate. The first line is the program, the second line is
the result:</p>
<pre><code>        &quot;abcde&quot;  powerlist  [size 3 &gt;]  filter
        [ &quot;abcde&quot; &quot;abcd&quot; &quot;abce&quot; &quot;abde&quot; &quot;acde&quot; &quot;bcde&quot; ]</code></pre>
<p>The powerlist operators can also be applied to a set. In the program
on the first line below the list of subsets is then filtered to retain
only those of size 3; the result is the list of subsets in the second
line:</p>
<pre><code>        {1 2 3 4}  powerlist  [size 3 =]  filter
        [ {1 2 3} {1 2 4} {1 3 4} {2 3 4} ]</code></pre>
<p>Suppose it is required to find the list, in ascending order, of all
sums of any three distinct numbers taken from a given set of numbers. We
already know how to get the list of all three-membered subsets. Each
should be replaced by its sum, and that can be done with the map
combinator applied to the whole list. The resulting list of sums then
needs to be sorted. The example in the first line does just that, giving
the result in the second line:</p>
<pre><code>        {1 2 3 4 5}  powerlist  [size 3 =] filter  [sum] map  qsort
        [6 7 8 8 9 9 10 10 11 12]</code></pre>
<p>In the remainder of this section a small program is to be constructed
which takes one sequence as parameter and returns the list of all
<em>permutation</em>s of that sequence. Here is a first draft:</p>
<pre><code>1         If  S has only zero or one member
2             then it has only one permutation, so take its unit list
3             else  take the first and rest of S,
                    recurse to construct the permutations of the rest
4                   insert the first in all positions in all permutations</code></pre>
<p>The recursion pattern is linear, so we can use the linrec combinator
to arrive at this first incomplete program:</p>
<pre><code>1       [ small ]
2       [ unitlist ]
3       [ uncons ]
4       [ &quot;insert the first in all positions in all permutations&quot; ]
5       linrec</code></pre>
<p>The anonymous recursion between steps 3 and 4 will have left a list
of permutations of the rest of <code>S</code> on top of the stack.</p>
<p>Next, it is necessary to insert the original first of <code>S</code>
into all positions into all these resulting permutations. This involves
replacing each single permutation by a list of permutations with the
original first inserted in all places.</p>
<p>This calls for the map combinator to apply a <em>constructed
program</em> to each permutation. The original first is currently the
second item on the stack. To make it available to the program to be
constructed, it is <code>swap</code>ped to the top. The required program
consists of a constant part and a variable part.</p>
<p>The constant part now has to be pushed onto the stack. Then the first
is <code>cons</code>ed into the required program. Then <code>map</code>
will create a list of list of permutations. But this is a two-level
list, and it should be one-level. So the two level list has to be
flattened to a one-level list.</p>
<pre><code>4.1             [ swap
4.2               [ &quot;the constant part of the program&quot; ]
4.3               cons map
4.4               &quot;flatten the resulting list of lists of sequences&quot; ]</code></pre>
<p>The constant part of the constructed program has to be written next.
The constructed program will be used to <code>map</code> all
permutations of the rest, and in each case it will begin by pushing the
original first on top of the current permutation being mapped. It then
has to insert this first into all positions of the current
permutation.</p>
<p>This again calls for a linear recursion with linrec. One way to do
this is to give this anonymous recursive function just one parameter,
the current permutation with the original first <code>swons</code> in as
an initial element. So the task is now to insert this inital element
into all positions in the remainder which is the current
permutation.</p>
<pre><code>4.2.2.1         If  the current sequence is small
4.2.2.2             then return just its unit list
4.2.2.3             else  keep  1. a copy
                                2. its second and
                                3. the sequence without its second
                          anonymously recurse on 3.
4.2.2.4                   construct a program to insert the second
                          use map to do the insertion
                          use cons to add the copy from 1.</code></pre>
<p>So the constant part 4.2 looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>4.2.1             [ swons
4.2.2.1             [ small ]
4.2.2.2             [ unitlist ]
4.2.2.3             [ dup unswons [uncons] dip swons ]
4.2.2.4             [ swap [swons] cons map cons ]
4.2.2.5             linrec ]</code></pre>
<p>The only other part that needs to be written is for flattening. This
should be trivial by now: If the list is small, then take its unit list
else take its first and its rest anonymously recurse on the rest,
concatenate the saved first into the result.</p>
<p>Here is the required program:</p>
<pre><code>4.4             [ null ] [ ] [ uncons ] [ concat]  linrec</code></pre>
<p>The entire program now is the following:</p>
<pre><code>1               [ small ]
2               [ unitlist ]
3               [ uncons ]
4.1             [ swap
4.2.1             [ swons
4.2.2.1             [ small ]
4.2.2.2             [ unitlist ]
4.2.2.3             [ dup unswons [uncons] dip swons ]
4.2.2.4             [ swap [swons] cons map cons ]
4.2.2.5             linrec ]
4.3               cons map
4.4               [null] [] [uncons] [concat] linrec ]
5               linrec.</code></pre>
<p>An essentially identical program is in the Joy library under the name
permlist. It is considerably shorter than the one given here because it
uses two subsidiary programs insertlist and flatten which are useful
elsewhere. The program given above is an example of a non-trivial
program which uses the linrec combinator three times and the map
combinator twice, with <em>constructed program</em>s as parameters on
both occasions.</p>
<p>Of course such a program can be written in lambda calculus languages
such as <em>Lisp</em>, <em>Scheme</em>, <em>ML</em> or <em>Haskell</em>,
but it would need many recursive definitions with attendant named formal
parameters.</p>
