<p>The language Joy is a purely functional programming language.
Whereas<br />
all other functional programming languages are based on the
application<br />
of functions to arguments, Joy is based on the composition of
functions.<br />
All such functions take a stack as argument and produce a stack as<br />
value. Consequently much of Joy looks like ordinary postfix
notation.<br />
However, in Joy a function can consume any number of parameters from
the<br />
stack and leave any number of results on the stack. The concatenation
of<br />
appropriate programs denotes the composition of the functions which
the<br />
programs denote. One of the datatypes of Joy is that of quoted
programs,<br />
of which lists are a special case. Some functions expect quoted
programs<br />
on top of the stack and execute them in many different ways,
effectively<br />
by dequoting. So, where other functional languages use abstraction
and<br />
application, Joy uses quotation and combinators â€“ functions which<br />
perform dequotation. As a result, there are no named formal
parameters,<br />
no substitution of actual for formal parameters, and no environment
of<br />
name-value pairs. Combinators in Joy behave much like functionals
or<br />
higher order functions in other languages, they minimise the need
for<br />
recursive and non-recursive definitions. Because there is no need for
an<br />
environment, Joy has an exceptionally simple algebra, and its
programs<br />
are easily manipulated by hand and by other programs. Many
programs<br />
first construct another program which is then executed.</p>
