<p>Prospectus for John Cowan's Joy1</p>
<p>John Cowan's Joy1 is essentially the old prototype of Joy with the following additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Floats (real numbers) as a new datatype, together with numerous new functions over floats.</li>
<li>Files as a datatype, together with some common functions for manipulating files and doing I/O.</li>
<li>Some new string functions. Also, on most platforms, an option to include garbage collection for strings.</li>
<li>Some bugs in the old prototype have been fixed. Portability has been further increased. Joy1 will still compile and run with any strictly conforming ISO C compiler.</li>
</ul>
<p>The currently supported platforms for the general garbage collector include Unix/Linux/*BSD on i386/Alpha/SPARC/SGI/HP, OS/2, Win32 native/Cygwin/DJGPP, and perhaps Macintosh. One system known <em>not</em> to work is OpenVMS (here the 4 C-files have to be compiled and linked in the usual manner). Joy1 has not yet been built on all these systems.</p>
<p>It is intended that the new implementation become known as Joy1, and that the earlier prototype, now Joy0, should gradually fade away. However, for compatiblity reasons the prototype Joy0 C sources have been updated (16-JUN-01).</p>
<p>I am enormously grateful to John for his work.</p>
