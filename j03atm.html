<p><em>by Manfred von Thun</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> Joy is a functional programming language based on
the composition of functions taking one stack as argument and yielding
one stack as value. Stacks can contain values of simple types such as
truth values, characters and integers, and values of aggregate types
such as sets, character strings and quoted programs with lists as a
special case. The stack functions include the usual operations such as
addition, comparison and list manipulation, but also many new kinds of
functions which dequote quoted programs in various ways. These new
functions behave like higher order functions, such as conditionals,
various forms of recursion, and for aggregates the map, fold and filter
functions. This paper gives an overview of the basic programs from which
others are built by composition and quotation.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The design of Joy was motivated mainly by <a
href="joybibl.html#17">{Backus78}</a> who argued that language concepts
should be selected on the basis of yielding strong and clean
mathematical laws. This paper describes the atomic programs of Joy from
which larger programs are concatenated, it does not describe the algebra
or other theoretical issues related to Joy.</p>
<p>Joy programs denote functions which take <em>state</em>s as arguments
and as values. Programs are built from atomic programs which also denote
functions which take states as arguments and as values. The meaning of
compound programs has to be given in terms of the meanings of atomic
programs. It is useful to classify atomic programs into categories
depending on what kind of function they denote. A coarse classification
distinguishes just three, called 1) the <em>literal</em>s, 2) the
<em>operator</em>s and 3) the <em>combinator</em>s.</p>
<p>Firstly, the <em>literal</em> atomic programs are those which look
like constants in conventional languages. They comprise literal numbers
(or, more correctly, numerals) such as integers, and other literals of
type character, string, truth value and set. Literals do not denote
numbers, characters, strings and so on, but they denote functions which
take one state as argument and yield as value another state which is
like the argument state except that the value of the literal has been
pushed onto the stack component.</p>
<p>Secondly, the <em>operator</em> atoms are those which look like
<em>n</em>-ary operators in other languages. They include the operations
such as for addition and the other arithmetical operations, and for the
various operations on other types. Like all programs, operators denote
functions from states to states, but the functions are not defined on
all states. An <em>n</em>-ary operator (such as the binary addition
operator) denotes a function which is defined only on states whose stack
component has <em>n</em> items (such as two integers) on top.</p>
<p>The function yields as value another state which is like the argument
state except that the <em>n</em> items on the stack have been replaced
by the result (such as the sum).</p>
<p>Also included as operators are those atoms denoting mere structural
functions of the stack component such as <code>dup</code>,
<code>swap</code> and <code>pop</code>, and those that involve input and
output such as <code>get</code> and <code>put</code>.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the <em>combinator</em> atoms are like operators in that
they require the top of the stack to contain certain items. But unlike
operators, they do not treat these items as passive data. Instead they
execute these items – and hence those items must be quoted programs. So,
combinators also denote functions which are defined only on states
having the appropriate number of quoted programs on top of the stack.
They yield as values another state which depends on the argument state,
including the quoted programs, and on the combinator itself.</p>
<p>Literals, operators and combinators can be concatenated to form
<em>program</em>s. These may then be enclosed in square brackets to form
literal <em>quotation</em>s. Such literals are not atomic, but if they
occur in a program they are treated just like other literals: they cause
the quoted program to be pushed onto the stack. So, literal quotations
denote functions which take any stack as argument and yield as value
another stack which is like the argument stack except that it has the
quotation pushed on top. Quotations on top of the stack can be treated
like other values, they can be manipulated, taken apart and combined,
but they can also be executed by combinators. If a quotation contains
only literals, then it is a value of the <em>list type</em>. The
component literals do not have to be of the same type, and they may
include further quotations. If a list is executed by a combinator, then
its components are pushed onto the stack.</p>
<p>The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: The next section
describes the principal types of Joy and their literals. Following that
are four sections on operators, the general ones applicable to all
types, then those applicable to simple types such as integers,
characters and truth values, then those applicable to aggregate types
such as strings, sets and lists, and finally the predicates which return
truth values. The following three sections deal with combinators, first
those that are independent of any typing, then those specialised to
simple types, and finally those specialised to aggregate types.</p>
<h1 id="types-and-literals">Types and Literals</h1>
<p>Joy programs are built from smaller programs by means of
concatenation. The ultimate building blocks are atomic programs which do
not have any programs as parts. Like all programs, atoms denote unary
functions. It is useful to classify atoms on the basis of what kinds of
functions they denote. Three broad classes can be distinguished in terms
of their domain and range. For expository purposes it is helpful to
adopt procedural terminology for a while, and to express the
classification in terms of what the atoms do to the stack component of
the state.</p>
<p>Some atoms can be applied to any stack and their effect is to push
something on the stack. The items that can be pushed are of various
types. There are <em>simple type</em>s such as integers, characters and
truth values. There are also <em>aggregate type</em>s such as strings,
sets and quoted programs. Atomic programs which push a simple or
aggregate value onto the stack will be called <em>literal</em>s. A
different kind of atom can be applied only to a non-empty stack. Their
effect is to re-organise the top few elements of the stack.</p>
<p>Some, like <code>dup</code>, <code>swap</code> and <code>pop</code>,
just edit the top few elements. Others expect the top few elements to be
of certain types and their effect is to replace these elements by the
result of applying a function to them as arguments. These include the
arithmetic and relational operators for addition, multiplication and
comparison, and the truthfunctional operators. They also include list
operations like concatenation. Collectively all of them will be called
<em>operator</em>s. A third kind of atoms expect quoted programs on the
top of the stack. Like the operators, they pop the quoted programs off
the stack. But they do not treat them as passive data structures in the
way operators do. Instead they cause the quoted programs to be executed.
These are called <em>combinator</em>s.</p>
<p>After this rough exposition of the classification it is important to
suppress any procedural reading and to revert to the official
interpretation of Joy programs as denoting unary functions. So the three
classes of atoms, namely literals, operators and combinators, all denote
unary functions from and to states which include a stack as a principal
component. The remainder of this section will deal with literals.</p>
<p>First, the literals of the <em>integer type</em>. The following is
the offical semantics of those atoms that look like numerals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A digit string such as “<code>123</code>” denotes not a
<em>number</em> but a <em>function</em> from states to states. For any
state S1 as argument this function yields as its value another state S2
which is like S1 except that its stack component has an additional item,
the <em>number</em> 123 pushed onto it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The semantics for the <em>truth value type</em> is similar: The two
symbols <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> denote functions which
for any state as argument yields as value another state which is like
the argument state except that the logical constant <code>true</code> or
<code>false</code> has been pushed onto the stack. Literals of the
<em>character type</em> can be treated just like small numbers. So, a
quoted character such as <code>'A</code> denotes a function taking any
state into another state with that character pushed onto the stack.</p>
<p>The three types of truth values, characters and integers constitute
what will be called simple types. They are simple in that their values
do not have parts. There are also aggregate types which do have parts.
The parts can be extracted by suitable operators and the aggregates can
be constructed from their parts. Joy has three different aggregate
types: sets of small numbers, strings of characters, and quoted
programs, which have lists as a special case.</p>
<p>The <em>set type</em> comprises the usual unordered collections
familiar from set theory. The elements of a set are written inside curly
braces, such as <code>{1 3 5}</code>. The whole is a literal atom, and
it denotes a function pushing that set onto the stack. For most
implementations on current machines the elements of sets will be small
numbers in the range <code>0</code> .. <code>31</code>, The <em>string
type</em> of character strings constitutes another aggregate type. Its
literals are written as zero or more characters enclosed in double
quotes, such as <code>"Hello"</code>. Such a literal again denotes a
function, one which pushes that string.</p>
<p>The third aggregate type is that of <em>quoted program</em>s, or
briefly, <em>quotation</em>s. Its literals are written inside square
brackets. A program consists of zero or more literals, operators or
combinators. Enclosing it in square brackets turns it into a quoted
program. Quotations denote functions which push the quoted program; the
quoted program is not executed, it is pushed onto the stack in
“suspended animation”. The following are quotations:</p>
<pre><code>        [1 2 3]                         [&#39;A &#39;B &quot;CDE&quot; {10 11 12}]
        [pop dup *]                     [[[]]]
        [peter paul mary]               [&quot;&quot; {} [] [hello &quot;Hello&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>A value of the <em>list type</em> is just a special case of a
quotation in which the elements are themselves literals. Quotations can
contain other quotations, and hence lists can contain other lists.</p>
<p>The following concerns connections between quotations and the stack.
The stack is normally a sequence of values of various types. This
sequence is just a special list which is modified by programs. Since it
is a list, it should be possible to put this list on top of the stack –
that is to say, on top of itself. Also, it should be possible to make
the list on top of the stack become the stack. Finally, it should be
possible to create a new, empty stack. There are three operators that do
just that:</p>
<pre><code>        stack    unstack    newstack</code></pre>
<p>The <code>stack</code> operator pushes onto the stack a list
containing all the elements of the stack. The <code>unstack</code>
operator expects a list on top of the stack and makes that the stack.
The <code>unstack</code> operator undoes what the <code>stack</code>
operator does, but the reverse is true only in special cases. The
<code>newstack</code> operator deletes the entire stack and replaces it
with a new, empty one. Also, it should be noted that the stack is not
always a sequence of values, it can also contain operators and
combinators. So, strictly speaking the stack is always a quotation, and
the <code>stack</code> operator pushes a quotation onto the stack, and
the <code>unstack</code> operator expects a quotation on the stack and
makes that the new stack.</p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to treat several types together. The
<em>numeric</em> types are integers and characters, the <em>Boolean</em>
types are truth values and sets, and the <em>sequence</em> types are
strings and lists. A <em>leaf</em> is anything which is not a list, and
a <em>tree</em> is either a leaf or a (possibly empty) list of
trees.</p>
<p>This completes the brief survey of the six principal types and their
literals. Other types might be included in more elaborate versions of
Joy. Obvious simple types to add are real (and perhaps complex) numbers,
and an enumeration type as in Pascal. It is less clear what new
aggregate types are useful since lists already are so versatile. Records
and arrays are certainly possible. Only files will be considered briefly
below.</p>
<h1 id="general-operators">General Operators</h1>
<p>An <em>operator</em> is a function which expects as argument one
stack whose top few elements satisfy some condition and which returns a
stack in which the top few elements have been replaced by something
else, and which otherwise is like the argument stack. For most operators
the top few elements are replaced by just one element, but there are
some for which they are replaced by none or by two. In fact, operators
may be defined in which any number (0, 1 …) of elements on the argument
stack are replaced by any number (0, 1 …) of elements on the result
stack. A <em>unary operator</em> is one whose argument stack requires at
least one element. A <em>binary operator</em> is one whose argument
stack requires at least two elements. There are even some <em>ternary
operator</em>s.</p>
<p>First, the following unary operators are defined on all stacks
containing at least one element:</p>
<pre><code>        pop    dup</code></pre>
<p>The top element does not have to satisfy any particular condition, it
can be of any type. The <code>pop</code> operator removes the top
element. The <code>dup</code> operator pushes a duplicate on top, so it
replaces the one original by two copies.</p>
<p>The following binary operators are defined on all stacks containing
at least two elements:</p>
<pre><code>        swap    popd    pop2    dupd</code></pre>
<p>The <code>swap</code> operator interchanges the top two elements. The
<code>popd</code> operator removes the second element. The
<code>pop2</code> operator removes the first and the second element. The
<code>dupd</code> operator duplicates the second element.</p>
<p>The following ternary operators are defined for all stacks containing
at least three elements:</p>
<pre><code>        swapd    rollup    rolldown</code></pre>
<p>The <code>swapd</code> operator interchanges the second and third
elements but leaves the first element in place. The <code>rollup</code>
operator moves the third and second element into second and first
position and moves the first element into third position. The
<code>rolldown</code> operator moves the second and first element into
third and second position and moves the third element into first
position.</p>
<p>There is another <em>ternary operator</em>:</p>
<pre><code>        choice</code></pre>
<p>The <code>choice</code> operator expects three values on top of the
stack, say <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code>, with
<code>Z</code> on top. The third value from the top, <code>X</code>, has
to be a truth value. If it is <code>true</code>, then the
<code>choice</code> operator just leaves <code>Y</code> on top of the
stack, and <code>X</code> and <code>Z</code> disappear. On the other
hand, if <code>X</code> is false, then the <code>choice</code> operator
just leaves <code>Z</code> on top of the stack, and <code>X</code> and
<code>Y</code> disappear. This operator is related to two combinators
<code>ifte</code> and <code>branch</code> which are explained in the
next sections.</p>
<p>There is another operator for multi-choices. It expects a non-empty
list of non-empty lists on top of the stack and below that one further
item:</p>
<pre><code>        opcase</code></pre>
<p>The <code>opcase</code> operator matches the type of the item with
the <code>first</code> members of the lists. When a match is found, the
<code>rest</code> of that list is pushed onto the stack. If no match is
found, then the last list is used as the default.</p>
<p>The following two operators handle input and output:</p>
<pre><code>        put    get</code></pre>
<p>The <code>put</code> operator expects one item on top of the stack,
it removes it and writes it to the output file. The <code>get</code>
operator expects one item in the input file, it reads it from there and
pushes it on top of the stack.</p>
<h1 id="operators-for-simple-types">Operators for Simple Types</h1>
<p>The following binary operators are defined for all numeric types.
They have their usual meaning, and the result is given the type of the
second parameter:</p>
<pre><code>        +    -    *    /    rem    max    min</code></pre>
<p>The following unary operators are defined for all numeric types:</p>
<pre><code>        succ    pred    abs    sign</code></pre>
<p>The <code>succ</code> and <code>pred</code> operators yield the
<em>successor</em> and <em>predecessor</em>, respectively. The
<code>abs</code> operator computes the <em>absolute value</em>, and the
<code>sign</code> operator returns the <em>signum</em> value, an integer
which is <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code> or <code>+1</code> depending on
whether the parameter is negative, zero or positive.</p>
<p>The following mathematical functions are provided:</p>
<pre><code>        fact    exp    fib    nfib    gcd</code></pre>
<p>The unary <code>fact</code> operator computes the <em>factorial</em>
function. The binary <code>exp</code> operator computes the
<em>exponentiation</em> function, the exponent is the top parameter. The
binary <code>fib</code> operator computes the <em>Fibonacci</em>
function. The binary <code>nfib</code> operator computes a similar
function, which is the number of calls which a recursive implementation
of the Fibonacci function would need; if this function is implemented
recursively, then the number of its calls is the same. The binary
<code>gcd</code> operator computes the <em>greatest common
divisor</em>.</p>
<p>The type of truth values is one of the Boolean types. The operators
are:</p>
<pre><code>        and    or    xor    not</code></pre>
<p>The three binary operators <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> and
<code>xor</code> compute the logical <em>conjunction</em>, <em>inclusive
disjunction</em> and <em>exclusive disjunction</em>. The unary
<code>not</code> operator computes the <em>negation</em>.</p>
<h1 id="operators-for-aggregate-types">Operators for Aggregate
Types</h1>
<p>The following unary operators expect a non-empty aggregate on top of
the stack:</p>
<pre><code>        first    second    third    rest</code></pre>
<p>The <code>first</code> operator extracts the first element of values
of the sequence types string and list. For sets it extracts the first
member using the underlying ordering. The <code>second</code> operator
expects an aggregate of at least two elements, for sequences it extracts
the second element, for sets it extracts the second element under the
ordering. The <code>third</code> operator expects an aggregate of at
least three members, it extracts the third element. The
<code>rest</code> operator expects an aggregate with at least one
member, it returns an aggregate which is like the parameter aggregate
but has its first element removed.</p>
<p>The following binary operators require an aggregate and a potential
member on top of the stack:</p>
<pre><code>        cons    swons</code></pre>
<p>The <code>cons</code> operator expects the aggregate on top of the
stack and the potential member below. The effect is to add the potential
member into the aggregate. In the case of strings and lists the
potential member is added in front. In the case of sets the potential
member is added only in case it is not already a member. The
<code>swons</code> operator does essentially the same except that it
expects the potential member on top and the aggregate below. Essentially
<code>swons</code> is equivalent to the composition
<code>swap cons</code>, and hence its name. The two operators are
<em>converse</em>s of each other.</p>
<p>The following unary operators also require a non-empty aggregate on
top of the stack:</p>
<pre><code>        uncons    unswons</code></pre>
<p>The <code>uncons</code> operator replaces the aggregate element by
two elements, the first and the rest, with the rest on top. The
<code>unswons</code> operator does the same, but with the first on top.
These two operators differ from other operators in that they leave
<em>two</em> values on top of the stack. Such operators would not make
much sense in other notations. Their names were chosen because their
effect is to undo the effect of the two binary operators
<code>cons</code> and <code>swons</code>.</p>
<p>There are four operators for <em>index</em>ing in various ways:</p>
<pre><code>        at    of    drop    take</code></pre>
<p>These four binary operators expect an aggregate and a number. That
number is used for indexing into the aggregate. The <code>at</code>
operator expects the aggregate <code>A</code> and above that a number
<code>N</code>, it returns that member of the aggregate which is at the
<code>N</code>-th position in the aggregate. The <code>of</code>
operator expects a number <code>N</code> and above that an aggregate
<code>A</code>, it returns the <code>N</code>-th member of
<code>A</code>. So the two operators are <em>converse</em>s of each
other. The <code>drop</code> and <code>take</code> operators both expect
an aggregate <code>A</code> and above that a number <code>N</code>. The
<code>drop</code> operator returns an aggregate like <code>A</code>
except that the first <code>N</code> elements have been removed. The
<code>take</code> operator returns an aggregate like <code>A</code>
except that only the first <code>N</code> elements have been retained.
For all four operators in the case of sequences the sequence ordering is
used, and for sets the underlying ordering is used.</p>
<p>The following are some general operators for aggregates:</p>
<pre><code>        size    reverse    concat    swoncat
        zip     flatten    transpose</code></pre>
<p>The unary <code>size</code> operator determines the number of
elements of any aggregate, and for lists this means top level members.
The unary <code>reverse</code> operator reverses strings and lists, it
has no effect on sets. The binary <code>concat</code> operator
concatenates two sequences of the same type, it appends the top
parameter to the second parameter. The <code>swoncat</code> operator
does the same except that it executes a <code>swap</code> first. The
binary <code>zip</code> operator expects two aggregates of the same
type. It returns a list of lists of two elements, each pair taken from
corresponding elements in the aggregates. The size of the result list is
the same as the size of the smaller of the two parameter aggregates. The
unary <code>flatten</code> operator expects a list of sequences and
combines them by concatenation. The unary <code>transpose</code>
operator is for matrix manipulation. It also expects a list of lists
<code>L1, L2 ...</code> and returns a list of lists. The first sublist
contains the first members of the <code>Li</code>, the second sublist
contains the second members, and so on. The list returned has as many
members as the shortest of the <code>Li</code>.</p>
<p>The type of sets is another of the Boolean types. The operators
are:</p>
<pre><code>        and    or    xor    not</code></pre>
<p>The three binary operators <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> and
<code>xor</code> compute the <em>intersection</em>, <em>union</em> and
<em>symmetric difference</em>. The unary <code>not</code> operator
computes the <em>complement</em>. For most implementations on current
machines the complement will be with respect to the largest set,
<code>{0..31}</code>.</p>
<p>The following operators on sequences deal with ordering of their
elements:</p>
<pre><code>        qsort    qsort1    merge</code></pre>
<p>The unary <code>qsort</code> operator uses the <em>quicksort</em>
algorithm to return a sorted version of the parameter. The
<code>qsort1</code> operator does the same, except that it expects a
list of sequences which it sorts according to the first element of the
sequences. The binary <code>merge</code> operator is like the
<code>concat</code> operator in that it produces a single sequence. The
difference is that it picks elements from the two sequences in
accordance with their order. If the two sequences were sorted, then the
result of merging them is also sorted.</p>
<p>The following are arithmetic operations for lists of numbers:</p>
<pre><code>        sum    product    scalarproduct</code></pre>
<p>The first two expect a list of numbers, the <code>sum</code> operator
adds them up, the <code>product</code> operator multiplies them, and for
empty lists the results are 0 and 1 respectively. The
<code>scalarproduct</code> operator expects a list of two lists of
numbers. It multiplies corresponding elements of the two lists and
returns the sum of these products.</p>
<p>The following unary operators expect an aggregate on top of the stack
and leave a list of various subaggregates on top of the stack:</p>
<pre><code>        frontlist    restlist    powerlist    subseqlist    permlist</code></pre>
<p>Let the size of the aggregate be (N). The frontlist and restlist
operators return a list of <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20N%2B1"
alt="N+1" title="N+1" class="math inline" /> subaggregates. The
<code>frontlist</code> operator returns a list, beginning with the empty
aggregate, obtained by successively adding the last, second last … first
member of the original aggregate. The <code>restlist</code> operator
returns a list, beginning with the original aggregate, by successively
removing the first, second … last member of the original aggregate. The
<code>powerlist</code> operator returns a list of all 2<sup>N</sup>
subaggregates such that for each member of the original aggregate there
will be one subaggregate in the list containing it and one not
containing it. The <code>subseqlist</code> operator is similar, but it
returns a shorter list of <img style="vertical-align:middle"
src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctextstyle%20N%20%2A%20%28N%20-%201%29%20%2F%202%20%2B%201"
alt="N * (N - 1) / 2 + 1" title="N * (N - 1) / 2 + 1"
class="math inline" /> subaggregates containing only consecutive members
of the original aggregate. The <code>permlist</code> only applies to
sequence aggregates, it returns a list of all the <code>N!</code>
(<code>N</code> factorial) permutations of the sequence.</p>
<p>A related binary operator is:</p>
<pre><code>        insertlist</code></pre>
<p>The <code>insertlist</code> operator expects a sequence and above
that another potential member. It returns the list of all sequences
obtained by inserting the potential member in all possible positions in
the sequence.</p>
<p>A related binary operator for finding the <em>cartesian product</em>
is:</p>
<pre><code>        cartproduct</code></pre>
<p>which expects two aggregates that do not have to be of the same type.
The <code>cartproduct</code> operator returns a list of all pairs (as
two element lists) of elements taken from the two aggregates. If the
aggregates have <code>M</code> and <code>N</code> members, there will be
<code>M × N</code> pairs in the result list.</p>
<p>The following unary operators expect a tree:</p>
<pre><code>        treeflatten    treestrip    treereverse    treesize</code></pre>
<p>The <code>treeflatten</code> operator turns a tree into a flat list
containing the leaves of the tree. The <code>treestrip</code> operator
returns a tree with the same structure but with all leaves removed. The
<code>treereverse</code> operator returns a tree in which (recursively)
all internal lists have been reversed. The <code>treesize</code>
operator returns an integer which is the number of leaves.</p>
<h1 id="predicates">Predicates</h1>
<p>A <em>predicate</em> is a function which leaves a truth value on the
stack. The following unary predicates are defined for all numeric
types:</p>
<pre><code>        odd    even    positive    negative</code></pre>
<p>The <code>odd</code> and the <code>even</code> predicate return
<code>true</code> or <code>false</code> just in case the parameter is
odd or even. The <code>positive</code> and the <code>negative</code>
predicate return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> just in case
the parameter is positive or negative – note that truth values and
characters are never negative.</p>
<p>The following binary predicates are defined for all numeric types,
they have their usual meaning:</p>
<pre><code>        =    !=    &lt;    &lt;=    &gt;    &gt;=</code></pre>
<p>The following are two unary predicates defined for all types:</p>
<pre><code>        null    small</code></pre>
<p>The <code>null</code> predicate is true if its simple parameter is
numerically zero or its aggregate parameter is empty. The
<code>small</code> predicate is true if its simple parameter is
numerically zero or 1, or its aggregate parameter contains at most one
element.</p>
<p>The following binary predicates test aggregates for members:</p>
<pre><code>        in    has</code></pre>
<p>The <code>in</code>-predicate is true if the second parameter is in
the top aggregate parameter. The <code>has</code>-predicate is true if
the aggregate second parameter has the top parameter as a member. The
two predicates are <em>converse</em>s of each other.</p>
<p>The following binary predicate is defined for two aggregates of the
same kind:</p>
<pre><code>        equal</code></pre>
<p>The <code>equal</code> predicate is true if the two aggregates have
the same members. For strings and sets this means same members in the
same positions. For lists this means recursive equality.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to test a parameter for its type. This is
done by the following unary predicates:</p>
<pre><code>        logical    char    integer    set    string    list    leaf</code></pre>
<p>The predicates <code>logical</code>, <code>char</code>,
<code>integer</code>, <code>set</code>, <code>string</code> and
<code>list</code> are true if the parameter is a truth value, character,
integer, set, string or list, respectively. The predicate
<code>leaf</code> is true if the parameter is not a list.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to operate on quoted predicates to obtain
another quoted predicate. There are three such operators:</p>
<pre><code>        conjoin    disjoin    negate</code></pre>
<p>The two operators <code>conjoin</code> and <code>disjoin</code>
expect two quoted predicates and return one quoted predicate. If that is
ever called it will compute the conjunction or disjunction of the two
parameters. The other operator is <code>negate</code> which expects one
quoted predicate and returns a quoted predicate which computes the
negation.</p>
<h1 id="general-combinators">General Combinators</h1>
<p>Most functional languages are based on the lambda calculus. As one of
their fundamental operations they use the <em>application</em> of a
function to its arguments or parameters. The formal parameters of
functions have explicit names, and application requires the substitution
of the actual parameters for the formal parameters. In Joy there are no
named formal parameters, and most of the work of application is done
instead by <em>combinator</em>s. Combinators behave like higher order
functions – they take other functions as parameters. However, they take
those other functions in the form of quoted programs from the stack.
Hence combinators are like literals and operators in that they denote
first order functions from states to states. This is possible because
the property of being higher order is transferred to (the stack
component of) the state. So, combinators require that the top of the
stack contains one or more quotations.</p>
<p>Combinators can be classified in many ways: in terms of the number of
expected quotations, in terms of the total number of expected
parameters, quotations and others, in terms of their behaviour, and so
on. To fix the terminology, combinators will be called <em>unary</em>,
<em>binary</em>, <em>ternary</em> and so on, if they expect one or two
or three quotations, and so on. But note that many combinators expect
further parameters below the quotations which they will execute. The
following are some simple <em>unary combinator</em>s which require the
top of the stack to be <em>one</em> quotation:</p>
<pre><code>        i    x    y</code></pre>
<p>The <code>i</code> combinator pops the quotation off the stack and
executes it, effectively by <em>dequoting</em>. The <code>x</code>
combinator leaves the quotation on the stack and executes it.
Consequently the <code>x</code> combinator will be executing on a stack
which has as its top element the very same quotation which it is
currently executing. The <code>y</code> combinator first converts the
quotation <code>[P]</code> into a different quotation <code>[Q]</code>
with the following strange property: if <code>[Q]</code> is ever called
by some combinator, then it builds a copy of itself on top of the stack
and then executes the <code>[P]</code>-part of itself. After this
conversion, the <code>y</code> combinator calls the <code>[Q]</code> it
has constructed. In this way the <code>y</code> combinator builds some
of the behaviour of the <code>x</code> combinator into the
<code>[Q]</code>.</p>
<p>Another unary combinator is:</p>
<pre><code>        nullary</code></pre>
<p>No matter how many parameters the quotation consumes from the stack
when <code>nullary</code> executes it, they are all restored and the
final value calculated by the execution of the quotation is pushed on
top of that.</p>
<p>The next unary combinators allow manipulation of the stack below the
top few elements:</p>
<pre><code>        dip    dipd    dipdd</code></pre>
<p>The <code>dip</code> combinator requires a further element
<code>X</code> to be below the quotation. It removes the quotation and
<code>X</code>, saves <code>X</code> somewhere, executes the quotation
on the remainder of the stack, and finally restores <code>X</code>. The
<code>dipd</code>and the <code>dipdd</code> combinator are similar. They
expect two or three elements, (X) and (Y), or (X), (Y) and (Z) below the
quotation. The two or three elements are saved and restored after the
execution of the quotation.</p>
<p>Three further unary combinators are:</p>
<pre><code>        i    unary2    unary3</code></pre>
<p>Apart from the quotation which they expect on top of the stack, they
require one or two or three further elements on the stack. So the
<del>app2</del><code>unary2</code> combinator requires two further
elements, say <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>. In this case the
quotation will be executed twice, once with <code>X</code> on top of the
stack and once with <code>Y</code> on top of the stack. The executions
could be done in any order, even concurrently, provided there are no
side effects. If both executions terminate, both should leave behind a
non-empty stack with respectively <code>X'</code> and <code>Y'</code> on
top.</p>
<p>These two values, in their order, are then pushed onto the stack in
place of <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>. The two other combinators
<del>app1</del><code>i</code> and <del>app3</del><code>unary3</code>
behave analogously: The <del>app1</del><code>i</code> combinator causes
just one execution of the quotation, and it replaces <code>X</code> by
<code>X'</code>. The <del>app3</del><code>unary3</code> combinator
causes three executions of the quotation, and it replaces
<code>X</code>, <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code> by <code>X'</code>,
<code>Y'</code> and <code>Z'</code>, maintaining the order.</p>
<p>The <em>binary combinator</em>s expect two quotations on top of the
stack:</p>
<pre><code>        b    cleave</code></pre>
<p>The <code>b</code> combinator expects two quotations <code>[P]</code>
and <code>[Q]</code>, with <code>[Q]</code> on top. It removes the two
quotations and executes first <code>[P]</code> and then
<code>[Q]</code>. The <code>cleave</code> combinator also expects two
quotations, and below that an item <code>X</code>. It also first
executes <code>[P]</code>, with <code>X</code> on top, and then saves
the top result element, say <code>P(X)</code>. Then it executes
<code>[Q]</code>, again with <code>X</code>, and saves the top result as
<code>Q(X)</code>. Finally it restores the stack to what it was below
<code>X</code> and pushes the two results <code>P(X)</code> and
<code>Q(X)</code>.</p>
<p>The <em>ternary combinator</em>s expect three quotations on top of
the stack. One of the most important is:</p>
<pre><code>        ifte</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ifte</code> (“if-then-else”) combinator performs branching.
Its third parameter is the if-part, its second parameter is the
then-part, its first parameter, on top, is the else-part. It executes
the if-part, which must yield a truth value. It saves that value and
restores the stack to what it was before the if-part was executed. If
the saved value was <code>true</code> the then-part is executed,
otherwise the else-part is executed.</p>
<p>There are two combinators for doing simple looping:</p>
<pre><code>        while    tailrec</code></pre>
<p>The binary <code>while</code><del>do</del> combinator is similar to
the <code>ifte</code> combinator in that it has a test, the while-part,
which is second on the stack. The combinator repeatedly executes the
while-part and while that yields <code>true</code> it executes the other
part, the do-part. The ternary <code>tailrec</code> (“tail-recursion”)
combinator also has a test, the third parameter. If that yields true,
the second parameter is executed and the combinator exits, otherwise the
top parameter is executed and after that the process is repeated.</p>
<p>The <em>quaternary combinator</em>s expect four quotations on top of
the stack:</p>
<pre><code>        linrec    binrec    genrec</code></pre>
<p>The <code>linrec</code> combinator for <em>linear recursion</em>
expects an if-part, a then-part, an else1-part and on top an else2-part.
Like the <code>ifte</code> combinator it executes the if-part, and if
that yields <code>true</code> it executes the else-part. Otherwise it
executes the else1-part, then it recurses with all four parts, and
finally it executes the else2-part. The binrec combinator for <em>binary
recursion</em> is similar, except that the else1-part has to produce two
values. The recursion with all four parts is executed on the two values
separately. The else2-part then has available the two results from these
two executions. The genrec combinator for <em>general recursion</em>
also has an if-part, a then-part and two else-parts.</p>
<p>It differs from the other two combinators in that after the execution
of the else1-part nothing in particular is executed, but a program
consisting of the four parts and the combinator is pushed onto the
stack. The else2-part thus has it available as a parameter.</p>
<p>For linear recursion the if-part often is <code>[null]</code> and the
else1-part often is either <code>[pred]</code> for numeric types or
<code>[uncons]</code> for aggregate types. The two parts are built
into:</p>
<pre><code>        primrec</code></pre>
<p>for <em>primitive recursion</em>. The binary primrec combinator
expects two quotations, a start-part (similar to the else-part of the
earlier combinators) and a combine-part (similar to the else2-part of
the earlier combinators. Below that it expects a value of any type. The
combinator essentially supplies the other two parts.</p>
<p>There are several combinators which do not have a fixed number of
quotation parameters. Instead they use a list of quotations. They
are:</p>
<pre><code>        cond    condlinrec</code></pre>
<p>The <code>cond</code> combinator is like the one in Lisp, it is a
generalisation of the <code>ifte</code> combinator. It expects a
non-empty list of programs, each consisting of a quoted if-part followed
by a then-part. The various if-parts are executed until one is found
that returns <code>true</code>, and then its corresponding then-part is
executed.</p>
<p>The last program in the list is the default which is executed if none
of the if-parts yield <code>true</code>. The <code>condlinrec</code>
combinator is similar, it expects a list of pairs or triples of quoted
programs. Pairs consist of an if-part and a then1-part, and triples have
an additional then2-part. Again the first if-part that yields
<code>true</code> selects its corresponding then1-part for execution. If
there is a then2-part, the combinator first recurses and then executes
the then2-part. The last program is the default, it does not have an
if-part.</p>
<p>The <code>cleave</code> combinator also has a generalisation:</p>
<pre><code>        construct</code></pre>
<p>expects two parameters, a quotation and above that a list of
quotations. Each quotation in the list will produce a value that will
eventually be pushed onto the stack, and the first quotation determines
the stack onto which these values will be pushed.</p>
<h1 id="combinators-for-simple-types">Combinators for Simple Types</h1>
<p>Some combinators expect values of specific types below their
quotation parameters. The combinators in this section expect values of
simple types.</p>
<p>The following binary combinator expects a truth value below its two
quotation parameters:</p>
<pre><code>        branch</code></pre>
<p>The <code>branch</code> combinator resembles the <code>choice</code>
operator and the <code>ifte</code> combinator. The truth value below the
two quotations determines which of the two quotations will be executed.
If the truth value is <code>true</code>, then the if-part, the second
parameter, is executed, otherwise the then-part, the top parameter, is
executed.</p>
<p>The following unary combinator expects a numeric value below its
quotation parameter:</p>
<pre><code>        times</code></pre>
<p>The <code>times</code> combinator executes its quotation parameter as
many times as indicated by the numeric value; if the value is zero or
less, then the quotation is not executed at all.</p>
<h1 id="combinators-for-aggregate-types">Combinators for Aggregate
Types</h1>
<p>The combinators in this section expect aggregates below their
quotation parameters.</p>
<p>The stack is just a list, so any list could serve as the stack,
including a list which happens to be on top of the stack. The following
unary combinator expects a list below its quotation parameter:</p>
<pre><code>        infra</code></pre>
<p>The <code>infra</code> combinator temporarily discards the remainder
of the stack and takes the list to be the stack. It then executes the
quotation which yields a result stack. This result is then pushed as a
list onto the original stack replacing the original list. Hence any
quotation can serve as a complex unary operation on lists.</p>
<p>The following unary combinator expects an aggregate below its
quotation parameter:</p>
<pre><code>        step</code></pre>
<p>The <code>step</code> combinator removes the aggregate and the
quotation, and then repeatedly puts the members of the aggregate on top
of the remaining stack and executes the quotation. For sequential
aggregates such as strings, lists or more generally, quotations, the
members are selected in the order of their occurrance in the aggregate.
For sets the members are selected on the basis of their underlying
order. So the quotation is executed as many times as the aggregate has
members. What happens to the members depends entirely on the quotation.
In the simplest though unlikely case where the quotation does nothing,
the members are left on the stack in the order in which they occurred in
the aggregate with the last member on top.</p>
<p>There is a related combinator for stepping through two
aggregates:</p>
<pre><code>        step2</code></pre>
<p>The <code>step2</code> expects two aggregates which do not have to be
of the same type. Above that it expects a quotation. It steps through
the lower aggregate and for each member it steps through the higher
aggregate. The pairs of members are then made available to the quoted
program. If the aggregates have <code>M</code> and <code>N</code>
members, there will be <code>M × N</code> pairs.</p>
<p>The following combinators for aggregates are mostly familiar from
list processing languages:</p>
<pre><code>        map    fold    filter    split</code></pre>
<p>All four step through the members of the aggregate in the same manner
as the <code>step</code> combinator. The <code>map</code> combinator
combines the results of applying the quotation to create a new aggregate
of the same type as the original. The <code>fold</code> combinator
expects a quotation which computes a binary function, below that a
value, the <em>initial</em> value, and below that an aggregate. It uses
the binary function to combine the members of the aggregate into one
single value, and if the aggregate happens to be empty it returns the
initial value.</p>
<p>The <code>filter</code> combinator needs a quotation which computes a
truth value, so it is a test. It applies the test to each member of the
aggregate and creates a new aggregate containing those members of the
original which pass the test. The resulting aggregate is of the same
types as the parameter. The <code>split</code> combinator only makes
sense in a language in which a function can return two values.</p>
<p>It is like the <code>filter</code> combinator except that it returns
two aggregates – one containing the members of the original which did
not pass the test, and above that another containing those which did
pass the test. The resulting aggregates are of the same type as the
parameter. In both result aggregates the ordering of the original
aggregate is preserved in case they are strings or lists.</p>
<p>The following unary combinators expect an aggregate below their
quotation parameter which must compute a truth value:</p>
<pre><code>        some    all</code></pre>
<p>The <code>some</code> combinator returns <code>true</code> if some
members of the aggregate pass the test of the quotation, otherwise it
returns <code>false</code>. The <code>all</code> combinator returns
<code>true</code> if all members of the aggregate pass the test of the
quotation, otherwise it returns <code>false</code>. For empty aggregates
<code>some</code> returns <code>false</code> and <code>all</code>
returns <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>The following unary combinator expects two aggregates and above that
a program suitable for combining their respective elements:</p>
<pre><code>        zipwith</code></pre>
<p>The <code>zipwith</code> combinator produces a list which is as long
as the smaller of the two aggregate parameters. The elements of the
resultlist are obtained by using the program parameter to combine
corresponding members of the two aggregates.</p>
<p>The following unary combinators expect a program and below that a
tree:</p>
<pre><code>        treestep    treemap    treefilter    treefold</code></pre>
<p>They all resemble corresponding combinators for aggregates. The
<code>treestep</code> combinator uses the program to process the leaf
nodes in the same way as <code>step</code> handles members of an
aggregate. The <code>treemap</code> combinator uses the program to
compute replacement leaves for a tree which has the same structure. The
<code>treefilter</code> combinator needs a program that yields a truth
value, it produces a tree of only those leaves which pass the test. The
<code>treefold</code> combinator expects an <em>initial</em> value above
the tree and above that the quotation which is used to combine the
leaves with the initial value.</p>
<p>There are two tree combinators which are similar to the
<code>genrec</code> combinator:</p>
<pre><code>        treerec    treegenrec</code></pre>
<p>and above that two quotations, <code>[O]</code> and <code>[C]</code>.
If the tree is a leaf, then <code>[O]</code> is executed, typically an
operation on a leaf. If the tree is not a leaf, then the combinator
<code>[C]</code> is executed, and it will find on top of the stack the
program <code>[[[O] C] treerec]</code>. The slightly more general
<code>treegenrec</code> combinator also expects a tree but above that
three quotations: <code>[O1]</code>, <code>[O2]</code> and
<code>[C]</code>. If the tree is a leaf, then <code>[O1]</code> is
executed. If it is not a leaf, then first <code>[O2]</code> is executed,
and then the combinator <code>[C]</code> is executed which will find
<code>[[[O1] [O2] C] treegenrec]</code> on top of the stack.</p>
