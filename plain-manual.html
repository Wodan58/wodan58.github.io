literal

 truth value type :  -&gt;  B
The logical type, or the type of truth values.
It has just two literals: true and false.

 character type   :  -&gt;  C
The type of characters. Literals are written with a single quote.
Examples:  &#39;A  &#39;7  &#39;;  and so on. Unix style escapes are allowed.

 integer type     :  -&gt;  I
The type of negative, zero or positive integers.
Literals are written in decimal notation. Examples:  -123   0   42.

 set type         :  -&gt;  {...}
The type of sets of small non-negative integers.
The maximum is platform dependent, typically the range is 0..31.
Literals are written inside curly braces.
Examples:  {}  {0}  {1 3 5}  {19 18 17}.

 string type      :  -&gt;  &quot;...&quot; 
The type of strings of characters. Literals are written inside double quotes.
Examples: &quot;&quot;  &quot;A&quot;  &quot;hello world&quot; &quot;123&quot;.
Unix style escapes are accepted.

 list type        :  -&gt;  [...]
The type of lists of values of any type (including lists),
or the type of quoted programs which may contain operators or combinators.
Literals of this type are written inside square brackets.
Examples: []  [3 512 -7]  [john mary]  [&#39;A &#39;C [&#39;B]]  [dup *].

Recursively traverses leaves of tree T, executes P for each leaf.

treerec    :  T [O] [C]  -&gt;  ...
T is a tree. If T is a leaf, executes O. Else executes [[O] [C] treerec] C.

treegenrec :  T [O1] [O2] [C]  -&gt;  ...
T is a tree. If T is a leaf, executes O1.
Else executes O2 and then [[O1] [O2] [C] treegenrec] C.

Sets flag that controls behavior of undefined functions
