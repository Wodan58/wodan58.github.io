<p><em>by Manfred von Thun</em></p>
<p><em>Abstract:</em> Joy is a functional programming language which is
not based on the application of functions to arguments but on the
composition of functions. The language makes extensive use of
combinators which perform the role of higher order functions. The
algebra of Joy programs can be used to express formal properties of many
first and second order functions without using variables ranging over
values or over functions. Some of these properties are idempotency,
inverses, converses, commutativity, symmetry, associativity,
homomorphisms and distribution. The paper also gives several analogues
of concepts from category theory.</p>
<p><em>Keywords:</em> functional programming, function composition,
algebra of programs, monoids, categories, functors, natural
transformations, monads.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This paper describes a rich algebra of Joy programs which can be used
for formal manipulation of Joy programs. Concatenation of Joy programs
denote the composition of the functions which the concatenated parts
denote. Hence if <code>Q1</code> and <code>Q2</code> are programs which
denote the same function and <code>P</code> and <code>R</code> are other
programs, then the two concatenations <code>P Q1 R</code> and
<code>P Q2 R</code> also denote the same function. In other words,
programs <code>Q1</code> and <code>Q2</code> can replace each other in
concatenations. This can serve as a rule of inference for
<em>rewriting</em>.</p>
<p>As premises one needs axioms such as in the first three lines below,
and definitions such as in the fourth line:</p>
<pre><code>(+)                2  3  +   ==   5
(dup)              5  dup    ==   5  5
(*)                5  5  *   ==   25
(def square)       square    ==   dup *</code></pre>
<p>A derivation using the above axioms and the definition looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>                   2  3  +  square
           ==      5  square                               (+)
           ==      5  dup  *                               (def square)
           ==      5  5  *                                 (dup)
           ==      25                                      (*)</code></pre>
<p>The comments in the right margin explain how a line was obtained from
the previous line. The derivation shows that the expressions in the
first line and the last line denote the same function, or that the
function in the first line is identical with the function in the last
line.</p>
<p>Consider the following equations in infix notation: The first says
that multiplying a number <code>x</code> by 2 gives the same result as
adding it to itself. The second says that the size of a reversed list is
the same as the <code>size</code> of the original list:</p>
<pre><code>        2 * x  =  x + x                 size(reverse(x))  =  size(x)</code></pre>
<p>In Joy the same equations would be written, <em>without
variables</em>, like this:</p>
<pre><code>        2  *   ==   dup  +              reverse  size   ==   size</code></pre>
<p>Other equivalences express algebraic properties of various
operations. For example, the predecessor <code>pred</code> of the
successor <code>succ</code> of a number is just the number itself. The
conjunction <code>and</code> of a truth value with itself gives just the
truth value. The less than relation <code>&lt;</code> is the converse of
the greater than relation <code>&gt;</code>. Inserting a number with
<code>cons</code> into a list of numbers and then taking the sum of that
gives the same result as first taking the sum of the list and then
adding the other number.</p>
<p>In conventional notation these are expressed by:</p>
<pre><code>        pred(succ(x))  =  x             x and x  =  x
        x &lt; y  =  y &gt; x                 sum(cons(x,y))  =  x + sum(y)</code></pre>
<p>In Joy these are expressed <em>without variables</em>:</p>
<pre><code>        succ  pred   ==   id            dup  and   ==   id
        &lt;  ==   swap &gt;                 cons  sum   ==   sum  +</code></pre>
<p>Some properties of operations have to be expressed by combinators.
One of these is the <code>dip</code> combinator which expects a program
on top of the stack and below that another value. It saves the value,
executes the program on the remainder of the stack and then restores the
saved value.</p>
<p>In the first example below, the <code>dip</code> combinator is used
to express the associativity of addition. Another combinator is the
<del>app2</del><code>unary2</code> combinator which expects a program on
top of the stack and below that two values. It applies the program to
the two values. In the second example below it expresses one of the De
Morgan laws. In the third example it expresses that the
<code>size</code> of two lists concatenated is the sum of the
<code>size</code>s of the two concatenands. The last example uses both
combinators to express that multiplication distributes (from the right)
over addition. (Note that the program parameter for
<del>app2</del><code>unary2</code> is first constructed from the
multiplicand and <code>*</code>.):</p>
<pre><code>        [+]  dip  +   ==   +  +
        and  not      ==   [not]  unary2  or    (* app2 *)
        concat  size  ==   [size]  unary2  +    (* app2 *)
        [+]  dip  *   ==   [*]  cons  unary2  + (* app2 *)</code></pre>
<p>The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: The next five
sections give detailed examples of algebraic laws which Joy operators
satisfy. All of these laws are well known when expressed in familiar
notation, what is new here is that they can be expressed in Joy notation
without the use of implicitly or explicitly universally quantified
variables. Then follow three sections using concepts from category
theory, but no previous knowledge is assumed.</p>
<h2 id="idempotency-inverses-and-unit-elements">Idempotency, inverses
and unit elements</h2>
<p>A unary function <code>f(x)</code> is said to be <em>idempotent</em>
if applying it once is “as good as” applying it twice. In conventional
notation this means that for all <code>x</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        f(f(x))  =  f(x)</code></pre>
<p>For example, the function <code>abs</code> which returns the absolute
value of a number is idempotent. Another one is the function defined on
lists or strings which returns a sorted version – sorting an already
sorted sequence makes no difference:</p>
<pre><code>        abs(abs(n))  =  abs(n)          sort(sort(s))  =  sort(s)</code></pre>
<p>Composition can be used to express that stack operations are
<em>idempotent</em>. The following express the idempotency of
<code>abs</code> and <code>sort</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        abs abs  ==  abs                sort sort  ==  sort</code></pre>
<p>Another idempotent Joy function, one which has no counterpart in
conventional notation, is the <code>newstack</code> function, it throws
away anything that is on the stack. Doing it twice in succession gives
the same result as doing it once:</p>
<pre><code>        newstack  newstack   ==   newstack</code></pre>
<p>The remainder of this section illustrates the use of the <em>identity
function</em> in Joy algebra. This function is denoted by the symbol
<code>id</code>. It has the property that for all programs
<code>P</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        id  P   ==   P   ==   P  id</code></pre>
<p>Let <code>f(x)</code> be a unary function. Another unary function
<code>g(x)</code> is said to be its <em>inverse</em> if for all
<code>x</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        g(f(x))  =  x</code></pre>
<p>For example, the predecessor function on integers is the inverse of
the successor function on integers: for all integers <code>x</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        pred(succ(x))  =  x</code></pre>
<p>It may or may not be that if one function is the inverse of a second
then the second is the inverse of the first. This is true of the
predecessor and successor functions when defined on integers, but not
when defined on natural numbers. The identity function can be used to
express that one function is the inverse of another and that certain
values are unit elements.</p>
<p>The atomic program <code>succ</code> denotes a function which takes a
stack as argument and yields a stack as value. The argument stack has to
have an integer (or a character) on top. The value stack is like the
argument stack except that the integer (or character) has been
incremented by 1. The semantics for <code>pred</code> is analogous, it
decrements the integer (or character). The following express that the
functions denoted by the symbols <code>succ</code> and <code>pred</code>
are <em>inverse</em>s of each other:</p>
<pre><code>        pred succ  ==  id               succ pred  ==  id</code></pre>
<p>The <code>cons</code> function expects a list on top of the argument
stack. Below that it expects another value. The value that is returned
is another stack which is like the argument stack except that the two
top elements of the argument stack have been replaced by a new list
which has the value inserted into it at the front. The
<code>uncons</code> function undoes this. It expects a non-empty list
and leaves the first and the rest of the list. The two functions are
inverses of each other:</p>
<pre><code>        cons uncons  ==  id             uncons cons  ==  id</code></pre>
<p>It is worth pointing out this cannot be expressed in conventional
notation because there the <code>uncons</code> operation makes no sense.
Actually, both functions are polymorphic in that instead of lists they
can operate on strings or on sets. The two equations still hold applied
to strings. Only the right equation holds for sets.</p>
<p>The symbols <code>pairlist</code>, <code>pairstring</code> and
<code>pairset</code> denote functions which expect two potential members
of lists, strings or sets on top of the stack. They return a new stack
with the two members replaced by a single list, string or set. The
polymorphic <code>unpair</code> function is their inverse, but not vice
versa. Since <code>unpair</code> leaves two results, the following have
no counterpart in conventional notation:</p>
<pre><code>        pairlist unpair    ==  id
        pairstring unpair  ==  id
        pairset unpair     ==  id</code></pre>
<p>Some functions are inverses of themselves. Examples of
<em>self-inverse</em> functions are the Boolean negation function and
the list reversal function: for all Boolean values <code>b</code> and
for all lists <code>l</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        not(not(b))  =  b               reverse(reverse(l))  =  l</code></pre>
<p>In Joy the two unary operators <code>not</code> and
<code>reverse</code> are polymorphic. The <code>not</code> operator
expects a truth value or a set on top of the stack and returns a stack
which has the complementary truth value or set on top of the stack. The
<code>reverse</code> operator expects a list or a string on top of the
stack and returns a stack which has the reversal the list or string on
top of the stack. The two functions are self-inverses, and this is
expressed by:</p>
<pre><code>        not not  ==  id                 reverse reverse  ==  id</code></pre>
<p>Let <code>f(x,y)</code> be a binary function. A constant
<code>c</code> is called a left or right <em>unit element</em> if the
first or the second equation holds for all <code>x</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        f(c,x)  =  x                    f(x,c)  =  x</code></pre>
<p>Left and right unit elements often coincide, and then they are just
called unit elements. In particular, this is true for the unit elements
of commutative functions. For example, 0 is the unit element for
addition, and 1 is the unit element for multiplication. In conventional
infix notation:</p>
<pre><code>        n + 0  =  n  =  0 + n            n * 1  =  n  =  1 * n</code></pre>
<p>The identity function can also be used to express that certain
literals are <em>right unit</em> elements for binary operations: 0 for
addition, 1 for multiplication, the <em>empty string</em>
<code>""</code> or the <em>empty list</em> <code>[]</code> for
concatenation, the truth value false and the <em>empty set</em>
<code>{}</code> for logical disjunction and set union, and the truth
value true for logical conjunction:</p>
<pre><code>        0 +        ==  id               1 *        ==  id
        &quot;&quot; concat  ==  id               [] concat  ==  id
        false or   ==  id               {} or      ==  id
        true and   ==  id</code></pre>
<h2 id="idempotency-zero-elements-and-arities">Idempotency, zero
elements and arities</h2>
<p>This section illustrates the <code>dup</code> and <code>pop</code>
operators in Joy algebra. The Joy operator dup expects one value on top
of the stack and pushes a duplicate on top. For example:</p>
<pre><code>        42 dup  ==  42 42</code></pre>
<p>Both sides of the equation denote compositions of two functions. On
the left the first function pushes a number and the second makes a
duplicate of the top element. On the right the two functions are the
same, each pushes a number. The equation says that the function on the
left is identical to the one on the right. Both functions are defined
for all stacks, and both return a stack which is like the argument stack
except that two copies of the number 42 have been pushed.</p>
<p>A binary function <code>f(x,y)</code> is called <em>idempotent</em>
if for all <code>x</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        f(x,x)  =  x</code></pre>
<p>Two examples are the Boolean conjunction and disjunction operations:
for all <code>b</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        b and b  =  b                   b or b  =  b</code></pre>
<p>In Joy the <code>dup</code> operator can express idempotency of the
Boolean operations and and or which are defined for truth values and for
sets. It can also express the idempotency of the numeric binary
<code>min</code> and <code>max</code> operators:</p>
<pre><code>        dup and  ==  id                 dup or   ==  id
        dup min  ==  id                 dip max  ==  id</code></pre>
<p>The Joy operator <code>pop</code> expects one value on top of the
stack and removes it. For example:</p>
<pre><code>        17 42 pop  ==  17</code></pre>
<p>On the left the composition of three functions first pushes two
numbers and then pops the second. On the right the function just pushes
the first number. The two functions are identical since for all argument
stacks they have the same result stack.</p>
<p>Let <code>f(x,y)</code> be a binary function. A constant
<code>c</code> is called a left or right <em>zero element</em> of
<code>f(x,y)</code> if the first or second equation holds for all
<code>x</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        f(c,x)  =  c                    f(x,c)  =  c</code></pre>
<p>For example, the number zero is a left and right zero element for
multiplication, and in conventional infix notation the laws looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>        0 * n  =  0                     n * 0  =  0</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pop</code> operator can also be used to express that
particular values are zero elements for binary operations: 0 for
multiplication, <code>false</code> and the empty set <code>{}</code> for
logical conjunction and set intersection, and <code>true</code> for
logical disjunction:</p>
<pre><code>        0 *        ==  pop 0
        false and  ==  pop false         {} and  ==  pop {}
        true or    ==  pop true</code></pre>
<p>The two operators <code>dup</code> and <code>pop</code> are related
by the identity:</p>
<pre><code>        dup pop  ==  id</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pop</code> operator can also be used to express the
<em>arity</em> of a function, the number of parameters which it expects.
For example, numbers are nullary, the successor function is unary, and
addition is binary. There is no way to express this in conventional
notation. In Joy it is expressed by:</p>
<pre><code>        42 pop  ==  id        succ pop  ==  pop        + pop  ==  pop pop</code></pre>
<p>Similar laws express that some operators return two results on the
stack:</p>
<pre><code>        uncons pop pop  ==  pop        dup pop pop  ==  pop</code></pre>
<h2 id="converses-commutativity-and-symmetry">Converses, commutativity
and symmetry</h2>
<p>This section illustrates the use of the <code>swap</code> operator in
Joy algebra. The Joy operator <code>swap</code> expects two values of
any type on top of the stack; its effect is to interchange them. The
operator is its own inverse:</p>
<pre><code>        swap swap  ==  id</code></pre>
<p>Let <code>f(x,y)</code> be a binary function. Another binary function
<code>g(x,y)</code> is its <em>converse</em> if for all <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        f(x,y)  =  g(y,x)</code></pre>
<p>For example, the numeric comparison relation <code>&lt;</code> has as
its converse the relation <code>&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        (i &lt; j)  =  (j &gt; i)</code></pre>
<p>In Joy notation the <code>swap</code> operator can express that
comparison predicates <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&lt;=</code> have as
their converses the predicates <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;=</code>
by the laws:</p>
<pre><code>        swap &gt;   ==   &lt;                swap &gt;=    ==    &lt;=</code></pre>
<p>The operator swons is similar to <code>cons</code>, it expects an
aggregate and a new value on top of the stack. It leaves a new aggregate
with the value inserted. But whereas <code>cons</code> expects the
aggregate on top and the value below, <code>swons</code> expects them in
the opposite order, the value on top and the aggregate below. It follows
that <code>swons</code> is the converse of <code>cons</code>. In the
same way, a binary string or list operation <code>swoncat</code> is
defined to be the converse of <code>concat</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        swap cons  ==  swons            swap concat  ==  swoncat</code></pre>
<p>One function is the converse of a second function if and only if the
second is the converse of the first. This says that converseness is a
symmetric relation. In Joy it is expressed by the following: for all
programs <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        swap P  ==  Q    if and only if    swap Q  ==  P</code></pre>
<p>From this rule and the previous equalities it follows that:</p>
<pre><code>        swap &lt;      ==   &gt;              swap &lt;=       ==  &gt;=
        swap swons  ==  cons            swap swoncat  ==  concat</code></pre>
<p>A binary function <code>f(x,y)</code> is <em>commutative</em> if it
is its own converse – if for all <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        f(x,y)  =  f(y,x)</code></pre>
<p>For example, addition of numbers is commutative, for all integers
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        i + j  =  j + i</code></pre>
<p>In Joy the <code>swap</code> operator can express that a function is
commutative:</p>
<pre><code>        swap +    ==  +                 swap *    ==  *
        swap and  ==  and               swap or   ==  or
        swap max  ==  max               swap min  ==  min</code></pre>
<p>Two sorted sequences can be combined with the <code>merge</code>
operator to form one new sorted sequence. Unlike concatenation, merging
is commutative:</p>
<pre><code>        swap merge  ==  merge</code></pre>
<p>A function which yields a truth value is often called a
<em>predicate</em>. Commutative predicates are often called
<em>symmetric</em>. For example, the <em>identity relation</em>
<code>=</code>, a binary predicate, is commutative or symmetric. Another
is the <code>equal</code> predicate which tests lists for identity,
including sublists and their sublists. In conventional notation, for all
integers or lists <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        (i = j)  =  (j = i)        equal(x,y)  =  equal(y,x)</code></pre>
<p>Turning these concepts on themselves, the converse relation is
symmetric: for all functions <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        (g is the converse of f)  =  (f is the converse of g)</code></pre>
<p>The same is not true for the inverse relation. The <code>swap</code>
operator can express that a binary predicate is <em>symmetric</em>. The
following express that <code>=</code> and <code>equal</code> are
symmetric:</p>
<pre><code>        swap =   ==   =                 swap equal  ==  equal</code></pre>
<p>With <code>swap</code> one can express that elements are <em>left
unit</em> elements for binary operations. In the case of operations such
as addition and the Boolean operations this already follows from their
commutativity. On the other hand, concatenation of strings or lists is
not commutative, but the empty string and the empty list are both right
and left unit elements for concatenation. They are also both right unit
elements for merge:</p>
<pre><code>        0 swap +        ==  id          1 swap *    ==  id
        false swap or   ==  id          {} swap or  ==  id
        true swap and   ==  id
        &quot;&quot; swap concat  ==  id          [] swap concat  ==  id
        &quot;&quot; swap merge   ==  id          [] swap merge   ==  id</code></pre>
<p>Some operators leave two elements on top of the stack, and two such
operators may be related in the sense that they just leave the elements
in a different order. This can also be expressed by
<code>swap</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        uncons swap  ==  unswons        unswons swap  ==  uncons</code></pre>
<p>There is even one operator which is related to itself in this way,
and that is <code>dup</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        dup swap  ==  dup</code></pre>
<p>Two operators related to <code>swap</code> are <code>rollup</code>
and <code>rolldown</code>. The <code>rollup</code> operator moves the
third and second element on the stack into second and first position,
and it moves the original first element into third position. The
<code>rolldown</code> operator moves the second and first element on the
stack into third and second position, and it moves the original third
element into first position. They can express laws such as:</p>
<pre><code>        rolldown  concat  concat   ==   concat  swoncat
        rollup  swoncat  concat    ==   swoncat  swoncat
        rollup  merge  merge       ==   merge  merge</code></pre>
<p>Their arities are expressed by:</p>
<pre><code>        swap  pop  pop   ==   pop  pop
        rollup  pop  pop  pop   ==   pop  pop  pop
        rolldown  pop  pop  pop   ==   pop  pop  pop</code></pre>
<h2 id="associativity">Associativity</h2>
<p>This section illustrates the use of the <code>dip</code> combinator
in Joy algebra.</p>
<p>The three previous sections have shown how a few Joy operations can
express a variety of well-known laws. In the sections to follow more
difficult Joy concepts will be needed. These resemble higher order
functions, but like everything else in Joy they really are just
functions from stacks to stacks. They differ from what are called the
operators in that they expect on top of the stack not just a passive
datum, but a quoted program which they execute. In accordance with an
older terminology they are here called <em>combinator</em>s.</p>
<p>One of these is the <code>dip</code> combinator. It expects a quoted
program on the top of the stack, and below at least one value of any
type. During execution it removes the program and the value from the
stack and saves them. Then it executes the program on the remainder of
the stack. Finally it restores the saved value to the top of the stack.
In most applications the program will be pushed just before the
combinator is to be applied. The combinator is useful for doing
something to the stack without disturbing the top value.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>        1 2 3 4 + * 5  ==  1 14 5
        1 2 3 4 5 [+ *] dip  ==  1 14 5</code></pre>
<p>In the first line on the left the 3 and the 4 are immediately added,
the result is multiplied by the 2 to give 14, and then the 5 is pushed
on top. In the second line the 5 is pushed immediately after the 4, and
consequently it is not possible to add the 3 and 4 without popping the 5
first. So, the program <code>[+ *]</code> is pushed and then executed by
<code>dip</code>. The results are the same as those in the two
(identical) right sides.</p>
<p>A binary function <code>f(x,y)</code> is said to be
<em>associative</em> if the result of applying it twice to three values
is independent of the order of application:</p>
<pre><code>        f(x,f(y,z))  =  f(f(x,y),z)</code></pre>
<p>For example, addition of numbers is associative:</p>
<pre><code>        i + (j + k)  =  (i + j) + k</code></pre>
<p>If <code>g(x,y)</code> is the converse of an associative
<code>f(x,y)</code>, then <code>g(x,y)</code> is also associative.</p>
<p>In Joy the <code>dip</code> combinator can be used to express
associativity:</p>
<pre><code>        [+] dip +  ==  + +              [*] dip *  ==  * *
        [and] dip and  ==  and and      [or] dip or  ==  or or
        [max] dip max  ==  max max      [min] dip min  ==  min min
        [concat] dip concat  ==  concat concat
        [swoncat] dip swoncat  ==  swoncat swoncat
        [merge] dip merge  ==  merge merge</code></pre>
<p>The following law expresses that the <code>dip</code> combinator
leaves one value unchanged:</p>
<pre><code>        dip  pop   ==   [pop]  dip  i</code></pre>
<h2 id="homomorphisms-de-morgan-and-distribution">Homomorphisms, De
Morgan and distribution</h2>
<p>This section illustrates the use of the
<del>app2</del><code>unary2</code> combinator in Joy algebra.</p>
<p>The <del>app2</del><code>unary2</code> combinator expects a quoted
program on top of the stack, and below that two data parameters. As with
all combinators, the program will be executed, in this case twice. In
case the program computes a unary function, the effect is to replace the
two data parameters by two corresponding values of that function. The
two evaluations could be done in parallel. The more general case where
the program does not denote a unary function is described further
down.</p>
<p>Let <code>f(x1,x2)</code> be a binary function defined on a type
<code>X</code>, and let <code>g(y1,y2)</code> be a binary function
defined on a type <code>Y</code>. Let <code>h(x)</code> be a function
from <code>X</code> to <code>Y</code>. Then <code>h(x)</code> is a
<em>homomorphism</em> from <code>X</code> and its binary function to
<code>Y</code> and its binary function when the following holds for all
<code>x1</code> and <code>x2</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        h(f(x1,x2)  =  g(h(x1),h(x2))</code></pre>
<p>One example is the logarithm function which maps logarithms of
products onto sums of logarithms. Two other examples are the doubling
function which maps integers with addition into even integers with
addition, and the squaring function which maps naturals with
multiplication into square naturals with multiplication and the size (or
length) of string function which maps the size of concatenations onto
sums of sizes. The <em>De Morgan</em> laws are another example:</p>
<pre><code>        log(x * y)  =  log(x) + log(y)
        double(x + y)  =  double(x) + double(y)
        square(x * y)  =  square(x) * square(y)
        size(concat(x,y))  =  size(x) + size(y)
        not(p and q)  =  not p or not q
        not(p or q)  =  not p and not q</code></pre>
<p>In Joy the <del>app2</del><code>unary2</code> combinator can be used
to express <em>homomorphism</em> laws, and these all take the form:</p>
<pre><code>        f  h   ==   [h]  unary2  g  (* app2 *)</code></pre>
<p>Some such laws are:</p>
<pre><code>        +  double         ==   [double]  unary2  +
        *  square         ==   [square]  unary2  *
        max  succ         ==   [succ]  unary2  max
        concat  size      ==   [size]  unary2  +
        concat  sum       ==   [sum]  unary2  +
        concat  product   ==   [product]  unary2  *
        concat  charset   ==   [charset]  unary2  or</code></pre>
<p>In the above, <code>charset</code> transforms a string of characters
into a set of characters, and the <code>or</code> operator computes set
union in this case. Another homomorphism is the <code>sort</code>
operator which maps unordered lists under concatenation onto ordered
lists under a binary <code>merge</code> operator which preseves
ordering:</p>
<pre><code>        concat  sort      ==   [sort]  unary2  merge        (* app2 *)</code></pre>
<p>The <del>app2</del><code>unary2</code> combinator can also be used to
express the familiar De Morgan laws for Boolean algebra and a (perhaps
surprising) isomorphic pair of laws for strings or lists:</p>
<pre><code>        and not           ==  [not] unary2 or               (* app2 *)
        or not            ==  [not] unary2 and              (* app2 *)
        concat reverse    ==  [reverse] unary2 swoncat      (* app2 *)
        swoncat reverse   ==  [reverse] unary2 concat       (* app2 *)</code></pre>
<p>Laws like the above generalise to <em>distribution</em> laws. In
these the unary function is replaced by a new binary function, and for
each element in the domain a unary function can be defined from the new
binary function by letting one parameter be the given element. It is
useful to distinguish <em>right distribution</em> and <em>left
distribution</em>.</p>
<p>A binary function <code>f(x,y)</code> distributes from the right over
another binary function <code>g(x,y)</code> if the following holds:</p>
<pre><code>        f(g(x,y),z)  =  g(f(x,z),f(y,z))</code></pre>
<p>In arithmetic we have the familiar example of multiplication
distributing from the right over addition. In Boolean algebra the
conjunction and disjunction operators distribute from the right over
<em>each other</em>. Here is the arithmetic law:</p>
<pre><code>        (i + j) * k  =  (i * k) + (j * k)</code></pre>
<p>The <del>app2</del><code>unary2</code> combinator can also express
<em>right distribution</em> laws. In each case there are three data
parameters on the stack, and the two ways of applying two functions are
equivalent. The one way is to apply the one function to the second and
third parameters (using the <code>dip</code> combinator) and then to
apply the distributing function to the result and the first parameters.
The other way is to use the first parameter and the distributing
function to make a <em>constructed program</em> that computes a unary
function, use <del>app2</del><code>unary2</code> to compute its values
for the second and third data parameters and to combine the two values
with the other function:</p>
<pre><code>        [+] dip *     ==  [*] cons unary2 +         (* app2 *)
        [and] dip or  ==  [or] cons unary2 and      (* app2 *)
        [or] dip and  ==  [and] cons unary2 or      (* app2 *)</code></pre>
<p>A binary function <code>f(x,y)</code> distributes from the left over
another binary function <code>g(x,y)</code> if the following holds:</p>
<pre><code>        f(x,g(y,z))  =  g(f(x,z),f(y,z))</code></pre>
<p>In arithmetic multiplication also distributes from the left over
addition:</p>
<pre><code>        i * (j + k)  =  i * j + i * k</code></pre>
<p>The <del>app2</del><code>unary2</code> combinator can also be applied
to a quoted program which does not compute a unary function, but
accesses data elements further down in the stack. In the examples below,
these elements have to be explicitly deleted later on, by
<code>[pop] dip</code>. It can be used to express <em>left
distribution</em> laws:</p>
<pre><code>        + *     ==  [*] unary2 + [pop] dip          (* app2 *)
        or and  ==  [and] unary2 or [pop] dip       (* app2 *)
        and or  ==  [or] unary2 and [pop] dip       (* app2 *)</code></pre>
<p>Apart from <del>app2</del><code>unary2</code> there are similar
combinators <del>app1</del><code>i</code> and
<del>app3</del><code>unary3</code>. Each expects a program
<code>[P]</code> on top of the stack and below that 1, 2 or 3 further
parameters and produces 1, 2 or 3 values. Some pertinent laws are:</p>
<pre><code>        [succ]  i  ==  succ            [not]  i  ==  not
        [pop]  dip  i         ==   unary2  pop
        [swap]  dip  unary2   ==   unary2  swap
        [dup]  dip  unary2    ==   i  dup</code></pre>
<p>The arities of these combinators are expressed by:</p>
<pre><code>        i  pop   ==   pop  pop
        unary2  pop  pop   ==   pop  pop  pop
        unary3  pop  pop  pop   ==   pop  pop  pop  pop</code></pre>
<p>There is a sense in which one might say that an integer has two
parts: a sign and an absolute value. When the two parts are multiplied,
the result is the same as the original. In the same way, a non-empty
list has two parts, its first and its rest. When the first is consed
into the rest, the result is the same as the original list. In
conventional notation this might be expressed as:</p>
<pre><code>        sign(x) * abs(x)  =  x
        cons(first(x),rest(x))  =  x</code></pre>
<p>The same may be expressed in Joy notation using the <code>dip</code>
combinator:</p>
<pre><code>        dup [sign] dip abs *  ==  id
        dup [first] dip rest cons  ==  id</code></pre>
<p>The laws look somewhat cleaner when expressed in terms of another
combinator. The <code>cleave</code> combinator expects two programs and
below that another item. It applies both programs to produce two
results, for example:</p>
<pre><code>        5  [pred]  [dup *]  cleave   ==   4  25</code></pre>
<p>The earlier laws about parts and wholes can then be expressed like
this:</p>
<pre><code>        [sign]  [abs]  cleave  *   ==   id
        [first]  [rest]  cleave  cons   ==  id</code></pre>
<p>The combinator <code>split</code> applied to a list and a test
predicate produces two lists, those members of the original list which
pass the test and those which fail. For any predicate, a list will have
two parts which can be merged to reconstitute the original list. In Joy
notation:</p>
<pre><code>        [sort] dip split merge   ==   pop  sort</code></pre>
<p>The law cannot be expressed in conventional notation because
<code>split</code> produces two results.</p>
<h2 id="the-list-functor-and-its-natural-transformations">The LIST
functor and its natural transformations</h2>
<p>This section uses several concepts from category theory. The
following brief sketch is unavoidably superficial, for a proper
exposition see <a href="joybibl.html#89">{Rydeheard85}</a> <a
href="joybibl.html#79">{Poigne92}</a>. For excellent short introductions
for computer science see <a href="joybibl.html#103">{Tennent91}</a> and
<a href="joybibl.html#110">{Walters91}</a>. Another short introduction
with an extensive bibliography is <a
href="joybibl.html#78">{Pierce91}</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>category</em> consists of a collection of <em>object</em>s and
for any two objects a collection of <em>morphism</em>s, each having the
one object as their <em>source</em> and the other object as their
<em>target</em>. In many categories the objects are just sets, or they
are sets with structure – algebras. Then the morphisms are unary
functions from sets to sets, or they are homomorphisms from algebras to
algebras. For any object the morphisms must include an <em>identity
morphism</em> with that object as source and target. Often there will be
other morphisms with that object as source and target. For any object
and two morphisms having a given object as target and source
respectively, there must be a composite morphism having as source the
source of the one component and as target the target of the other.</p>
<p>This composition of morphisms must be associative, with identity
morphisms as left and right unit elements. These requirements are
satisfied for categories of sets and functions and for categories of
algebras and homomorphisms. But there are many categories that are quite
different. One kind of example are <em>monoid</em>s: an associative
binary operation over a set which includes a left and right unit
element. Here the category consists of just one object (which is of no
interest), but many morphisms, the elements of the monoid. There are
many other kinds of categories which are different again.</p>
<p>Categories deal with two sorts of things, objects and morphisms. So
they are two-sorted algebras. Between categories there are morphisms
called <em>functor</em>s. These take objects and morphisms of one
category into objects and morphisms of another category. In computer
science the most familiar functors are the <em>type constructor</em>s.
They take integers, characters, truth values and so on into
<code>LIST</code>s of integers, <code>LIST</code>s of characters,
<code>SET</code>s of integers and so on. The functors must <em>also</em>
take integer functions such as squaring into corresponding functions on
<code>LIST</code>s or <code>SET</code>s of integers.</p>
<p>In computing circles the corresponding functions are usually written
<code>map(square,L)</code>, for a list <code>L</code>. In category
theory the same symbol is used for objects and morphisms, so the
examples are written <code>LIST(integer)</code> and
<code>LIST(square)</code>. In Joy there is no explicit type notation at
all, and <code>map</code> is just one of many combinators. Programs to
compute the list of squares of a given list can be written in either of
these two ways:</p>
<pre><code>        [square]  map                   [dup *]  map</code></pre>
<p>Between any two functors <code>F</code> and <code>G</code> there can
be functions called <em>natural transformation</em>s. These take as
arguments the values of <code>F</code> and <code>G</code> at their
objects. A function <code>n</code> is natural if for all morhisms
<code>m</code> in the domains of <code>F</code> and <code>G</code> the
following holds for all <code>x</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        n(F(m)(x))  =  G(m)(n(x))</code></pre>
<p>Initially we shall only be concerned with the case where
<code>F</code> and <code>G</code> are the same functor
<code>LIST</code>. Then an example of a natural transformation from
lists to lists is the reverse function: for all functions <code>f</code>
and lists <code>L</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        reverse(LIST(f)(L)  =  LIST(f)(reverse(L))</code></pre>
<p>or in conventional notation:</p>
<pre><code>        reverse(map(f,L))  =  map(f,reverse(L))</code></pre>
<p>In Joy algebra the naturality of <code>reverse</code> is expressed
by:</p>
<pre><code>        [reverse]  dip  map   ==   map  reverse</code></pre>
<p>In computer science natural transformations are often called
<em>polymorphic</em> functions, in the case of lists they are
independent of the type of the elements of the lists. Four other
naturality laws, expressed in conventional notation:</p>
<pre><code>        map(f,rest(L))  =  rest(map(f,L))
        f(first(L))  =  first(map(f,L))
        map(f,concat(L1,L2))  =  concat(map(f,L1),map(f,L2))
        map(f,cons(x,[]))  =  cons(f(x),[])
        map(f,unitlist(x))  =  unitlist(f(x))</code></pre>
<p>The last two laws of course say the same thing. In Joy these would be
expressed by:</p>
<pre><code>        [rest]  dip  map     ==   map  rest
        [first]  dip  i      ==   map  first
        [concat]  dip  map   ==   [map]  cons  unary2  concat  (* app2 *)
        [[] cons] dip map    ==   i [] cons
        [unitlist] dip map   ==   i  unitlist</code></pre>
<p>Note that in the third equation on the right the
<del>app2</del><code>unary2</code> combinator has to use a
<em>constructed program</em>. The last two laws again say the same
thing.</p>
<p>Somewhat more difficult is the naturality of <code>cons</code>. In
conventional notation this is expressed by:</p>
<pre><code>        map(f,cons(x,L))  =  cons(f(x),map(f,L))</code></pre>
<p>and in Joy notation by:</p>
<pre><code>        [cons]  dip  map   ==   dup  [dip]  dip  map  cons</code></pre>
<p>This is so complex that a step-by-step verification is called for.
Let <code>L</code> and <code>x</code> be the list and the additional
member. Let <code>[F]</code> be a program which computes the function
<code>f</code>. Let <code>x'</code> be the result of applying
<code>f</code> to <code>x</code>, and let <code>L'</code> be the result
of applying <code>f</code> to all members of <code>L</code>. The proof
of the equivalence of the LHS and the RHS consists in showing that both
reduce to the same program. For the LHS we have:</p>
<pre><code>        x  L  [F]  [cons]  dip  map                             LHS
    ==  x  L  cons  [F]  map                                    (dip)
    ==  [x L]  [F]  map                                         (cons)
    ==  [x&#39; L&#39;]                                                 (map)</code></pre>
<p>For the RHS:</p>
<pre><code>        x  L  [F]  dup  [dip]  dip  map  cons                   RHS
    ==  x  L  [F]  [F]  [dip]  dip  map  cons                   (dup)
    ==  x  L  [F]  dip  [F]  map  cons                          (dip)
    ==  x&#39;  L  [F]  map  cons                                   (dip)
    ==  x&#39;  L&#39; cons                                             (map)
    ==  [x&#39; L&#39;]                                                 (cons)</code></pre>
<p>The two sides reduce to the same program, so they denote the same
function.</p>
<p>A similar equation is the following:</p>
<pre><code>        map   ==   [uncons]  dip  dup  [dip]  dip  map  cons</code></pre>
<p>But note that this is not suitable as a definition, since the RHS
only applies to non-empty lists. The following is a suitable recursive
definition:</p>
<pre><code>        map   ==   [ pop null ]
                   [ pop ]
                   [ [uncons]  dip  dup  [dip]  dip  map  cons ]
                   ifte</code></pre>
<p>The fact that <code>map</code> does not change the number of elements
in a list is expressed in conventional notation by:</p>
<pre><code>        size(map(f,L))  =  size(L)</code></pre>
<p>and in Joy notation by:</p>
<pre><code>        map  size   ==   pop  size</code></pre>
<p>An important combinator for any aggregate is <code>filter</code>,
which expects an aggregate und below that a quotation which implements a
predicate. It returns an aggregate of the same type as the parameter
containing only those members for which the predicate yielded
<code>true</code>. Given two aggregates, it does not matter whether they
are first combined and then filtered, or first filtered separately and
then combined. For sequences the law is this:</p>
<pre><code>        [concat] dip filter  ==  [filter] cons unary2 concat  (* app2 *)</code></pre>
<p>For sets the combining operator has to be <code>or</code> instead of
<code>concat</code>.</p>
<p>Another law concerns passing an aggregate first through one filter
and then passing the result through another filter. Passing the
aggregate through the conjunction of these filters produces the same
result. The <code>conjoin</code> operator takes two quoted predicates
and returns one quoted predicate which is their conjunction:</p>
<pre><code>        [filter] dip filter  ==  conjoin filter</code></pre>
<p>The following laws concern the <code>sum</code>s and
<code>product</code>s of lists of integers:</p>
<pre><code>        cons sum      ==  sum +         sum      ==  uncons sum +
        cons product  ==  product *     product  ==  uncons product *</code></pre>
<p>(Only the equations on the left could be expressed in conventional
notation.)</p>
<p>This holds:</p>
<pre><code>        P  ==  uncons Q   iff   cons P  == Q</code></pre>
<h2 id="other-functors-and-their-natural-transformations">Other functors
and their natural transformations</h2>
<p>As indicated in the previous section, apart from <code>LIST</code>
there are other functors such as <code>SET</code>. So there is the type
<code>SET(integer)</code>, the function <code>SET(square)</code> which
maps a set of integers into the set of their squares, and similarly for
other integer functions. Much of what was said about lists and their
natural transformations has counterparts for sets and their natural
transformations. In Joy there are several implementations of <em>set
type</em>s. The simplest is in terms of bitstrings with potential
elements <code>0</code> .. <code>31</code>, such sets are written in
curly braces, as in <code>{1 3 5}</code>. Values of this type can be
manipulated by the combinator <code>map</code> and the operators
<code>first</code>, <code>rest</code> and <code>cons</code>. Instead of
the operator <code>concat</code> the set union operator or applies. The
naturality of these operators is expressed by:</p>
<pre><code>        [rest]  dip  map      ==   map  rest
        [first]  dip  map     ==   map  first
        [or]  dip  map        ==   [map]  cons  unary2  or  (* app2 *)
        [{} cons]  dip  map   ==   i  {}  cons
        [cons]  dip  map      ==   dup  [dip]  dip  map  cons</code></pre>
<p>Now we have two functors, <code>LIST</code> and <code>SET</code>.
Lists have order and may have repetitions, sets have neither. A useful
function from lists to sets is the function elements which removes order
and repetitions. For example, in Joy notation:</p>
<pre><code>        [ 3 1 5 1 ]  elements   ==   { 1 3 5 }</code></pre>
<p>It makes no difference whether the set of elements of a list is taken
first and then the set is mapped through a function, or whether the list
is first mapped through the same function and then the set of elements
is taken. This is the naturality of the <code>elements</code> function,
expressed by:</p>
<pre><code>        [elements]  dip  map   ==   map  elements</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>        [ 3 1 5 1 ]  [dup *]  [elements]  dip  map
    ==  [ 3 1 5 1 ]  elements  [dup *]  map
    ==  { 1 3 5 }  [dup *]  map
    ==  { 1 9 25 }</code></pre>
<p>and:</p>
<pre><code>        [ 3 1 5 1 ]  [dup *]  map  elements
    ==  [ 9 1 25 1 ]  elements
    ==  { 1 9 25 }</code></pre>
<p>Halfway between lists and sets are multisets or <em>bag</em>s; these
have no order but may have repetitions. A <code>BAG</code> functor would
be similar to <code>LIST</code> and <code>SET</code>, and there would be
natural transformations from bags to bags, from lists to bags, and from
bags to sets. Currently Joy does not have an implementation of bags.</p>
<p>A list can have as its members other lists, for example lists of
integers. Formally these are of type <code>LIST(LIST(integer))</code>.
This uses the <code>LIST</code> functor composed with itself:
<code>LIST</code> ° <code>LIST</code>. Such a list can be mapped through
a function by mapping each sublist, for example:</p>
<pre><code>        [[1 2 3][4 5]]  [[dup *] map]  map   ==   [[1 4 9][16 25]]</code></pre>
<p>Here the second <code>map</code> is applied to the whole list, the
first or inner <code>map</code> is applied to the sublists.
Alternatively a combinator <code>mmap</code> can be defined by:</p>
<pre><code>        mmap   ==   [map]  cons  map</code></pre>
<p>and then one can write:</p>
<pre><code>        [[1 2 3][4 5]]  [dup *]  mmap  ==  [[1 4 9][16 25]]</code></pre>
<p>Whereas a list is one-dimensional, a <em>matrix</em> is
two-dimensional. Matrices can be implemented as lists of lists, and the
sublists can be interpreted either as the rows or the columns. One
important operation on matrices is the interchange of rows and columns.
The transpose operator does just that:</p>
<pre><code>        [[1 2][3 4]]  transpose   ==   [[1 3][2 4]]</code></pre>
<p>Transposition is another polymorphic function or natural
transformation for matrices. It does not matter whether a matrix is
first transposed and then mapped elementwise through a function, or
whether it is first mapped and then transposed:</p>
<pre><code>        [transpose]  dip  mmap   ==   mmap  transpose</code></pre>
<p>The operator <code>zip</code> will transform two lists of the same
length into a list of pairs, for example:</p>
<pre><code>        [1 2 3]  [4 5 6]  zip   ==   [[1 4][2 5][3 6]]</code></pre>
<p>The <code>zip</code> operator can be defined by:</p>
<pre><code>        zip   ==   []  cons  cons  transpose</code></pre>
<p>The <code>zip</code> function is natural, <code>zip</code>ping the
two lists and then <code>mmap</code>ing has the same effect as
<code>map</code>ping and then <code>zip</code>ping:</p>
<pre><code>        [zip]  dip  mmap   ==   [map]  unary2  zip  (* app2 *)</code></pre>
<p>A similar naturality law holds for the <code>cartproduct</code>
operator which produces the <em>cartesian product</em> of two aggregates
which do not have to be of the same type:</p>
<pre><code>        [cartproduct] dip  mmap   ==   [map] unary2  cartproduct  (* app2 *)</code></pre>
<p>Another useful datatype is that of <em>tree</em>s, also called
<em>recursive list</em>s. A tree of integers is either an integer or a
list of trees of integer. A <em>proper tree</em> is a list of trees. The
type gives rise to a functor <code>TREE</code>, with the data type
<code>TREE(integer)</code> and mapping functions such as
<code>TREE(square)</code>. In Joy the combinator for tree mapping is
<code>treemap</code>. Most of the operations on lists also apply to
proper trees. Reversal can be done by <code>reverse</code> just at the
top level, or by treereverse all the way down into all sublists. Some
naturality laws are:</p>
<pre><code>        [reverse]  dip  treemap   ==   treemap  reverse
        [treereverse]  dip  treemap   ==   treemap  treereverse
        [rest]  dip  treemap   ==   treemap  rest
        [first]  dip  i   ==   treemap  first
        [[] cons]  dip  treemap   ==   treemap  []  cons</code></pre>
<p>Proper trees can be <code>treeflatten</code>ed to form a one-level
list. For example:</p>
<pre><code>        [ [1 [2 3] [] 4] [5] ]  treeflatten   ==   [ 1 2 3 4 5 ]</code></pre>
<p>The <code>treeflatten</code>ing function is a natural transformation
between the <code>TREE</code> and <code>LIST</code> functors, the order
of <code>treeflatten</code>ing and <code>map</code>ping does not
matter:</p>
<pre><code>        [treeflatten]  dip  map   ==   treemap  treeflatten</code></pre>
<p>The following also holds:</p>
<pre><code>        treereverse  treeflatten   ==   treeflatten  reverse</code></pre>
<p>A <em>bare tree</em> is either the empty list <code>[]</code> or it
is a list of bare trees. Formally there is a functor
<code>BARETREE</code>, and for (degenerate) functions which can only
take <code>[]</code> as parameters <code>BARETREE(f)</code> maps bare
trees with contained <code>[]</code> into trees. Proper trees can also
be <code>strip</code>ped of their leaves to form a bare tree:</p>
<pre><code>        [ [1 [2 3] [] 4] [5] ]  strip   ==   [ [ [] [] ] [] ]</code></pre>
<p>The <code>strip</code> function commutes with <code>reverse</code>
and <code>treereverse</code>:</p>
<pre><code>        reverse  strip   ==   strip  reverse
        treereverse  strip   ==   strip  treereverse</code></pre>
<p>Once <code>strip</code>ped, there is nothing for <code>treemap</code>
to do:</p>
<pre><code>        [strip]  dip  treemap   ==   treemap  strip   ==   pop strip</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-list-monad">The LIST monad</h2>
<p>This section gives a superficial sketch of monads, another useful
concept from category theory. For a fuller exposition see <a
href="joybibl.html#13">{Arbib-Manes75}</a>, <a
href="joybibl.html#14">{Asperti-Longo91}</a> and especially <a
href="joybibl.html#108">{Wadler92}</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>monad</em> <code>M</code> over a category consists of a functor
from the category to itself, and two natural transformations. The first
transformation <code>joinM</code> takes as argument an object in the
target of the square of the functor and gives as value an object in the
target of the functor. The second transformation <code>unitM</code>
takes as argument an object in the category and gives as value an object
in the target of the functor. The two transformations must satisfy two
laws which are expressed in terms of two variants obtained by applying
the functor to the two transformations:</p>
<p>From the first transformation one can define a variant by applying
the functor to it. This variant is again a natural transformation, it
takes as argument an object in the target of the cube of the functor and
gives as value an object in the target of the square of the functor. The
first transformation or its variant may be composed with the first
transformation. The two compositions are again natural transformations,
they take as argument an object in the cube of the functor and give as
value an object in the target of the functor. The first defining law for
monads is that these two compositions must be identical.</p>
<p>Similarly, from the second transformation one can define a variant by
applying the functor to it. This variant is again a natural
transformation, it takes as argument a value object in the target of the
functor. The second transformation or its variant may be composed with
the first transformation. The two compositions take as argument a value
object in the target of the functor. The second defining law for monads
is that these two compositions must both be equal to the identity
function.</p>
<p>The above will now be illustrated with the <em>LIST monad</em>. Its
functor is the <code>LIST</code> functor. Its first natural
transformation is usually called flatten, which concatenates a two-level
list to produce a single-level list. Its second natural transformation
is the unary unitlist operation which takes any argument to produce its
singleton list. Here are two examples:</p>
<pre><code>        [[1 2 3] [peter paul]] flatten   ==  [1 2 3 peter paul]
        [[1 2 3] [peter paul]] unitlist  ==  [[[1 2 3] [peter paul]]]</code></pre>
<p>The two required variants are obtained by applying the
<code>LIST</code> functor, as <code>map</code>.</p>
<p>The variant of the <code>flatten</code> operator is the polymorphic
operator:</p>
<pre><code>        [flatten]  map</code></pre>
<p>which takes a list of (lists of lists) as argument and concatenates
the (list of lists) but leaves the outer level list structure intact.
This is an example:</p>
<pre><code>        [[[1 2] [3]] [[a] [b]]]  [flatten] map  ==  [[1 2 3] [a b]]</code></pre>
<p>The first monad law can now be written in Joy notation. It says that
there are two equivalent ways of flattening a list of lists of lists to
produce a list:</p>
<pre><code>        [flatten]  map  flatten   ==   flatten  flatten</code></pre>
<p>The variant of <code>unitlist</code> is the polymorphic operator:</p>
<pre><code>        [unitlist] map</code></pre>
<p>which takes a list of elements and produces the list of their
unitlists. An example is:</p>
<pre><code>        [1 2 [3 4]]  [unitlist] map   ==   [[1] [2] [[3 4]]]</code></pre>
<p>The second monad law can now be written in Joy as:</p>
<pre><code>        [unitlist] map  flatten   ==   id   ==   unitlist  flatten</code></pre>
<p>As natural transformations both <code>flatten</code> and
<code>unitlist</code> interact with the <code>LIST</code> functor
operating (as <code>map</code>) on arbitrary functions. There are two
further laws that arise. Because these two laws are more general than
the preceding ones, they are also more useful:</p>
<p>A list of lists can be mapped at the second level through an
arbitrary function using the <code>mmap</code> combinator, producing
another list of lists. That can then be <code>flatten</code>ed to
produce a single level list. The same original list of lists can first
be <code>flatten</code>ed to produce a single level list which can then
be mapped at the top level using <code>map</code>. The two results are
the same, and in Joy this is expressed as:</p>
<pre><code>        mmap  flatten   ==   [flatten] dip  map</code></pre>
<p>A function may be applied to an argument of any type, and then the
<code>unitlist</code> can be taken. Alternatively the
<code>unitlist</code> can be taken first and then the result can be
mapped through the function. That the results are the same can be
written in Joy as:</p>
<pre><code>        i  unitlist   ==   [unitlist] dip  map</code></pre>
<p><a href="joybibl.html#108">{Wadler92}</a> shows that in any monad it
is possible to define another natural transformation, <em>monadic
composition</em> which simultaneously resembles function application and
function composition. For the <code>LIST</code> monad it takes as one of
its arguments a list and as the other argument a function which yields a
list as value. The result is again a list. In Joy it might be defined
by:</p>
<pre><code>        bind   ==   map  flatten</code></pre>
<p>It satisfies the following laws:</p>
<pre><code>        [unitlist] dip  bind   ==   i
        [unitlist] bind   ==   id
        [K [H] bind] bind  ==  [K] bind  [H] bind</code></pre>
<p>The first two laws say that <code>unitlist</code> is a left and right
identity for <code>bind</code>, the third says that <code>bind</code> is
associative. The third law is here expressed with program variables
<code>K</code> and <code>H</code>. Alternatively it is expressed by:</p>
<pre><code>        [bind] cons  concat  bind   ==   [bind] dip  bind</code></pre>
<p>Wadler makes extensive use of many <code>bind</code>-like functions
for monads other than the <code>LIST</code> monad.</p>
<p>A very general theory of lists, without the use of category theory,
is given in <a href="joybibl.html#26">{Bird86}</a>. A very readable
introduction to the <code>LIST</code> functor can be found in <a
href="joybibl.html#96">{Spivey89}</a>. The theory of lists is
generalised by <a href="joybibl.html#68">{Malcolm89}</a> to what have
been called rose trees. <a href="joybibl.html#72">{Meijer-etal91}</a>
give a comprehensive collection of laws of functional programming using
very general functional forms for lists and other data types. <a
href="joybibl.html#29">{Bird-deMoor92}</a> use categories, homomorphisms
and algebraic techniques to solve sophisticated optimisation problems in
functional programming. It appears that most, and perhaps even all, of
the contributions in the above papers can be translated into Joy
notation.</p>
