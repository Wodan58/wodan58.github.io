<blockquote>
	The joy-funs-doc files are containing a brief description
	of all Joy Atoms and of the Definitions of the Basic Joy 
	Libraries.
	</br></br>
	The pdf, ps and calltips(1) versions are identical in content. The html 
	version is similar but somewhat smaller and older. Anyhow, it
	covers all important words of Joy. Pdf and
	ps have an index, html has not. Please use your browsers search 
	button whenever you are looking for a special word.</br>
	<small>In case you don't see anything after downloading the pdf version: scroll down.</small>

	This library is containing a few definitions I found helpful 
	while working with Joy. Some definitions of this library are
	documented in the joy-funs-doc files (not in the html).

	is used as base for ps and pdf.) Written in Joy. -->
<!-- I called it Rabbit because there where always rabbits 
in the garden, eating my salad, when I started working on it.
Whenever I was got tired of bug tracking, something I still
find difficult especially in Joy, I watched these sweet little
rabbits... -->

(1) Some text editors for programmers support <strong>calltips</strong>: 
little yellow boxes that pop up to remind you what the arguments and return type 
of a function are. NEdit supports calltips since version 5.4 .
