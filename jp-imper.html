<h1 id="imperative-thinking-for-joy-programs">Imperative thinking for
Joy programs</h1>
<p><em>by Manfred von Thun</em></p>
<p>Joy is a purely functional language, and yet it is often useful to
think in imperative mode when writing Joy programs. This results from
the fact that Joy is based on the composition of functions, and not on
the application of functions. This was first made explicit by Billy
Tanksley (2000) in his preamble to the mailing group <a
href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/concatenative/info">concatenative</a></p>
<p>This note illustrates imperative thinking for five Joy programs. In
the literature these are often written recursively. But they either are
tail recursive or can be rewritten in a tail recursive form, possibly
using accumulators. Consequently these programs can also be written in
an imperative style without recursion but using loops. In this note the
imperative version is used as the starting point which is then
translated into purely functional Joy.</p>
<p>The first two programs are for computing the
<strong>factorial</strong> and the <strong>Fibonacci</strong> functions.
Both use the <strong>times</strong> combinator of Joy. The third and
fourth program are for computing the greatest common divisor function
<strong>gcd</strong> and the predicate for determining whether a number
is <strong>prime</strong>. Both use the <strong>while</strong>
combinator of Joy. The last program is a combinator for Newton’s method
of finding arguments for which a given function returns a zero value.
The method works by starting with a guessed argument and improving it
until it has the required magnitude. This Joy program also uses the
<strong>while</strong> combinator. The method can also be used to
compute inverses of functions, for example for finding cube-roots when
given a cubing function.</p>
<p>All five programs were developed using corresponding Scheme programs
in <a href="joybibl.html#113">Abelson and Sussman (1985)</a> as a
guide.</p>
<h2 id="the-times-combinator-for-the-factorial-function">The
<em>times</em> combinator for the <em>factorial</em> function</h2>
<p>The factorial function is often given a recursive definition to
illustrate either recursion in general or definitions in a particular
language. But it is well known that recursion is not necessary, and that
at least a “tail-recursive” variant is more efficient. For a given
positive integer N, the factorial of N is just the product of the first
N positive integers. The product of no numbers should be the identity
element for multiplication, so the factorial of 0 is set to 1. Hence for
any non-negative N the factorial can be computed by a simple imperative
program (here in a fantasy language):</p>
<pre><code>    factorial(N) =
    VAR P := 1
    VAR I
    FOR I := 1 TO N DO
        P := P * I
    RETURN P</code></pre>
<p>The upper limit N ensures that the body of the loop will be executed
exactly N times. In addition, the FOR-loop will increment the variable I
exactly as required. But we could do the incrementing explicitly:</p>
<pre><code>    factorial(N) =
    VAR P := 1
    VAR I := 1
    N TIMES DO
        P := P * I
        I := I + 1
    RETURN P</code></pre>
<p>To translate this into Joy, here is a first draft. The TIMES-loop
will be executed by the times combinator of Joy. The body of the loop
will need to be expressed in Joy, but we do that later. Before the loop
there will need to be some initialisation corresponding to the
imperative program. And after the loop there will need to be some
finalisation corresponding to the RETURN.</p>
<pre><code>    factorial  ==
    &quot;initialise&quot;
    [ &quot;body of loop&quot; ]
    times
    &quot;finalise&quot;</code></pre>
<p>A call to the factorial function will be of the form</p>
<pre><code>   N  factorial</code></pre>
<p>where the N will have to be available for the times combinator. That
means that the simulation initialisation of the two variables P and I
will have to be below the N. In the imperative program both were
initialised to 1. So below the parameter N there will need to be two
further stack elements, both 1, that are pushed under the control of the
dip combinator. Hence the initialisation is:</p>
<pre><code>   [ 1 1 ]  dip</code></pre>
<p>The body of the Joy loop has to do what the body of the imperative
loop does:</p>
<pre><code>       P := P * I
       I := I + 1</code></pre>
<p>The counterpart of P has to be multiplied by the counterpart of I,
but there has to be another copy of I available to be incremented by 1.
So the body of the Joy loop has to start with a dup operator to make
that copy. Then the counterpart of P has to be multiplied by the
original counterpart of I, and this has to occur below the new copy of
the counterpart of I. That is easily done by the combination [*] dip.
Finally, corresponding to the incrementing of I, the successor of the
top element is taken. Hence the body of the Joy loop is</p>
<pre><code>   dup  [*]  dip  succ</code></pre>
<p>The loop is executed N times, and when that is done the imperative
program returns P, whose counterpart is the second element from the top
of the stack. So the finalisation of the Joy program is</p>
<pre><code>   pop</code></pre>
<p>Putting the three pieces together, we have the definition</p>
<pre><code>    factorial  ==
    [1 1] dip
    [ dup [*] dip succ ]
    times
    pop</code></pre>
<p>This completes the Joy program. In the Joy library <a
href="https://github.com/Wodan58/joy1/blob/master/lib/numlib.joy">numlib.joy</a>
it is just a one-liner:</p>
<pre><code>    fact == [1 1] dip [dup [*] dip succ] times pop;</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-times-combinator-for-the-fibonacci-function">The
<em>times</em> combinator for the <em>Fibonacci</em> function</h2>
<p>The Fibonacci function is also often given a recursive definition,
generally just to test efficiency of an implementation because a
non-recursive definition would be more efficient. The usual recursive
definition is inefficient because the same values have to be computed
many times over. The following is a design of a non-recursive
version.</p>
<p>The Fibonacci function for the first two natural numbers 0 and 1 as
arguments has the values 0 and 1, and for any larger numbers as
arguments it values is just the sum of its values for the two preceding
numbers. The following gives the arguments and the values:</p>
<pre><code>        arguments     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   ...
        values        0   1   1   2   3   5   8  13  21   ...</code></pre>
<p>Note that to compute the later values only the values for the
<em>two</em> preceding numbers are needed. This helps in the following
consideration, where the values are now arranged in a staircase:</p>
<pre><code>        arguments     values
                0     0   1
        1         1   1
        2             1   2
        3                 2   3
        4                     3   5
        5                         5   8
        6                             8  13</code></pre>
<p>Each step of the staircase consists of two numbers, the left and the
right, hereafter called L and R. Three observations can be made: (1) In
the first, topmost step L and R are respectively the Fibonacci values
for 0 and 1. (2) The two numbers L and R of any step other than the
first are obtained from the L and R of the preceding step - the two
numbers L and R are interchanged and then a new R is obtained by adding
L to it. (3) The Fibonacci value of N is on the N-th step from the top
in the L number. The three observations suffice for the following
program. Again it uses a TIMES-loop to execute (2) as often as required
by the parameter N.</p>
<pre><code>    fibonacci(N) =
    VAR L := 0
    VAR R := 1
    N TIMES DO
        L =:= R
        R := L + R
    RETURN L</code></pre>
<p>The mutual assignment operator “=:=” swaps the values of the two
variables. It might be implemented instead by</p>
<pre><code>   TEMP := L; L := R; R := TEMP</code></pre>
<p>The program translates readily into Joy. A call to the Joy program
will be of the form</p>
<pre><code>   N  fibonacci</code></pre>
<p>and hence the N will have to be available for the times loop. So the
initialisation has to take place just below the parameter N, with</p>
<pre><code>   [0  1]  dip</code></pre>
<p>Now the N will be consumed by the times combinator, and that will
expose two numbers corresponding to the values of L and R, with the
value of R topmost. The times combinator requires a quotation which
corresponds to the body of the imperative TIMES loop. The quotation has
to swap the two numbers on top of the stack, and then replace the top
value by two sum of the two, but without consuming the second value.
This replacement can be done by [+] unary. So the quotation required
is</p>
<pre><code>   [ swap  [+]  unary ]</code></pre>
<p>Finally, the value to be returned is what corresponds to L in the
imperative program, and that is the second value from the top of the
stack. So the finalisation is simply</p>
<pre><code>   pop</code></pre>
<p>Putting the pieces together, this is the definition:</p>
<pre><code>    fibonacci  ==
         [1 0] dip
         [swap [+] unary]
         times
         pop</code></pre>
<p>In the Joy library numlib.joy this is also just a one-liner:</p>
<pre><code>    fib == [1 0] dip [swap [+] unary] times pop;</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-while-combinator-for-the-gcd-function">The <em>while</em>
combinator for the <em>gcd</em> function</h2>
<p>The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two natural numbers is that
number which divides the two given numbers without remainder. Euclid’s
famous algorithm for finding the gcd is based on the observation
that</p>
<pre><code>   gcd(I,J)   ==   gcd(J, I rem J)</code></pre>
<p>where I rem J is the remainder of dividing I by J. For J = 0 the gcd
is I. The steps for finding the gcd of 48 and 90 are:</p>
<pre><code>        step     values
            1     48  90
        2         90  48
        3             48  42
        4                 42   6
        5              6   0</code></pre>
<p>Again there is a staircase with two values on each step, hereafter L
and R. The first step consists of the two arguments. On every succeeding
step L is what was the R of the preceding step, and the R is L rem R of
the preceding step. This might be written in an imperative language with
a WHILE-loop as</p>
<pre><code>    gcd(L, R)  =
    VAR TEMP
    WHILE R &gt; 0 DO
        TEMP := R
        R := L rem R
        L := TEMP
    RETURN L</code></pre>
<p>The program might even be written without the TEMP variable but with
mutual assignment like this:</p>
<pre><code>    gcd(L, R)  =
    WHILE R &gt; 0 DO
        L := L rem R
        L =:= R
    RETURN L</code></pre>
<p>We now have to translate this into Joy. The call to the gcd program
in Joy will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>   48  90  gcd</code></pre>
<p>Joy has a while combinator with takes two quotation parameters, a
while-part and a do-part. The structure of the program will be</p>
<pre><code>    gcd  ==
    [ &quot;while-part&quot; ]
    [ &quot;do-part&quot; ]
    while
    &quot;finalise&quot;</code></pre>
<p>So the while-part will have to test whether the number on top of the
stack is positive, and that is done with the quotation</p>
<pre><code>   [ 0 &gt; ]</code></pre>
<p>The do-part will have to take the two parameters on top of the stack
and simulate the effect of the assignment statements of one or the other
of the imperative versions. (1) The top element on the stack will have
to become the result of the rem operation. (2) The second element on the
stack will have to be what was the first element. Since the rem
operation in (1) consumes the top element, but (2) needs it, that top
element will have to be saved by a dup (similar to using the TEMP).
After the dup the second and third element will have to available for
the rem operation, and below the result of that will have to be the
saved or duplicated first element. So before the rem the top three
elements have to be shuffled by rollup, which moves the second and third
element up by one and the first element down by two. Thus the do-part
is</p>
<pre><code>   [ dup  rollup  rem ]</code></pre>
<p>The finalisation of course just pops off the 0 which is now on top of
the stack.</p>
<p>So the entire definition is:</p>
<pre><code>    gcd  ==
    [ 0 &gt;]
    [ dup rollup rem ]
    while
    pop</code></pre>
<p>In the Joy library numlib.joy this is also just a one-liner:</p>
<pre><code>    gcd == [0 &gt;] [dup rollup rem] while pop;</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-while-combinator-for-the-prime-predicate">The <em>while</em>
combinator for the <em>prime</em> predicate</h2>
<p>One number N has another D as a divisor if and only if N divided by D
leaves no remainder, or a remainder of 0. A number N has a proper
divisor D if and only if N has a divisor D where D is other than 1 or N.
A number N is prime if and only if it has no proper divisors. If a
number is not prime, then it has a proper divisor D no greater than the
square root of N, or equivalently the square of D is no greater than
N.</p>
<p>So, given a number N, the search for a proper divisor could start
with a test integer T = 2 and go up to that value of T for which N is
greater than the square of T. During each step a test needs to be made
to determine whether the remainder of dividing N by T is positive. After
each step T is incremented. The loop continues while N is greater than
the square of T AND T is not a divisor of N. The loop stops when the
preceding conjunction becomes false. Since there are two conjuncts,
there are two possible reasons why the conjunction has become false. If
the second conjunct fails then N is not prime, even if the first
conjunct, N &gt; T * T, is true. On the other hand, if the first
conjunct failed, then T has already been incremented beyond the search
range and hence N is prime. So N is prime if and only if the loop has
terminated with N &lt; T * T. This algorithm can be expressed in an
imperative language as:</p>
<pre><code>    prime(N) =
    VAR T := 2
    WHILE (N &gt; T * T) AND (N rem T &gt; 0) DO
        T := T + 1;
    RETURN N &lt; T * T</code></pre>
<p>The program translates well into Joy. Clearly it must have the
structure</p>
<pre><code>    prime ==
    &quot;initialise&quot;
    [ &quot;termination-conjunction&quot; ]
    [ &quot;increment-test-value&quot; ]
    while
    &quot;finalise&quot;</code></pre>
<p>It is important that the conjunction and the incrementation of the
loop be done efficiently. This affects whether the initial test value 2
should be inserted above or below the given number on top of the stack.
Individually the two conjuncts for the termination are best written
as</p>
<pre><code>   dup * &gt;
   rem 0 &gt;</code></pre>
<p>which suggests that the test value is above the argument. Hence the
initialisation should simply push the inital test value 2. Also, the
test value should remain above the argument, and the incrementing is
done simply by the succ operator. But the termination has to be a
conjunction of the two conjuncts above, so they have to produce a truth
value each which are then conjoined by the and operator. One way is to
use the nullary combinator on the first conjunct to produce the first
truth value without using up the two arguments. Then the two arguments
can be used for the other conjunct with the dip combinator. So the
entire termination conjunction is</p>
<pre><code>   [ [dup * &gt;] nullary  [rem 0 &gt;] dip  and ]</code></pre>
<p>The finalisation translates easily from the imperative program:</p>
<pre><code>   dup  *  &lt;</code></pre>
<p>So the entire program is as follows, as it appears in the library
numlib.joy:</p>
<pre><code>    prime ==
    2
    [ [dup * &gt;] nullary  [rem 0 &gt;] dip  and ]
    [ succ ]
    while
    dup * &lt; ;</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-while-combinator-for-the-newton-combinator">The
<em>while</em> combinator for the <em>newton</em> combinator</h2>
<p>Given a differentiable function F of one variable, one sometimes
needs to find its roots, those values x for which F(x) = 0. One famous
method, due to Newton, is the following: Start with a guess G for what
that value x might be. Compute F(G), and if that is close enough to
zero, take G to be the solution. Otherwise, use the current guess and
the function F to find a better guess. Repeat this process until the
latest guess is acceptable. This is essentially a WHILE loop.</p>
<p>So Newton’s method is a general algorithm which takes two parameters,
an initial guess G and a function F. In imperative style an outline is
this:</p>
<pre><code>    newton(G,F) =
    WHILE &quot;F(G) is not close enough to 0&quot; DO
        &quot;Use F and G to find a new G&quot;
    RETURN G</code></pre>
<p>For the WHILE-part it is necessary to specify a criterion for what
counts as close enough to 0. Some small value can be built into the
algorithm. It is also possible to make the value a further parameter.
For simplicity this version will select the value 0.0001 hardwired into
the program. Since the function F can return a positive or a negative
value for the current guess, it is necessary to take the absolute value
instead. So the refinement for the WHILE-part is this:</p>
<pre><code>   abs(F(G)) &gt; 0.0001</code></pre>
<p>The DO-part is more complicated. To find a better guess, it is
necessary to use the old guess to determine whether the new guess should
be larger or smaller, and by how much. In Newton’s method the slope of
the function F at the old guess is used. The new guess is then computed
by subtracting from the old guess a value that depends on (1) the value
of F at the old guess, and (2) the slope of F at the old guess. It is
the slope that determines how close the new guess will be to the old
guess. The slope of F at the old guess is of course the value of the
derivative of F, which might be written as deriv(F). So the DO-part
refines to</p>
<pre><code>   G  :=  G - F(G)/deriv(F,G)</code></pre>
<p>Combining the parts the imperative version of Newton’s method is the
following.</p>
<pre><code>    newton(G,F) =
    WHILE  abs(F(G)) &gt; 0.0001  DO
        G   :=  G  -  F(G)/deriv(F,G)
    RETURN G</code></pre>
<p>For the derivative of the function F we again have to select a small
number - ideally “infinitesimal” - say 0.001. Then F has to be applied
to two values, x plus 0.001 and x. The difference between the two
results is divided by 0.001 to get an approximation to the true slope of
F at x. A definition might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>    deriv(F,x) =
    (F(x + 0.001) - F(x)) / 0.001</code></pre>
<p>The imperative newton program and the second order derivative
function are now to be translated into Joy. It so turns out that the
derivative of a function F is useful elsewhere. The most general form
would be one which takes as a parameter a quotation, say [F], and which
returns a quotation [D]. Both quotations would have to compute unary
functions, and either quotation would be used by some combinator, quite
possibly the i combinator. From the above formula we see that F is to be
applied separately to two arguments, firstly to x + 0.001, and secondly
to just x alone. Since x is needed twice, the argument has to be
duplicated, and the small value 0.001 added to one of them. That is
essentially</p>
<pre><code>   dup  0.001  +</code></pre>
<p>After the given quotation [F] has been applied to these two
arguments, their difference has to be divided by 0.001. But the
difference has to be computed in the right order, so a swap is needed
before the subtraction. This fragment of the program thus is:</p>
<pre><code>   unary2  swap  -  0.001  /    (* app2 *)</code></pre>
<p>A call to the derivative program takes a parameter [F] as argument
and it produces another quotation:</p>
<pre><code>   [F]  deriv   ==&gt; [ dup 0.001 + [F] unary2 swap - 0.001 / ]     (* app2 *)</code></pre>
<p>The required quotation is constructed from [F] by the following
program:</p>
<pre><code>   deriv == [unary2 swap - 0.001 /] cons  [dup 0.001 +] swoncat;  (* app2 *)</code></pre>
<p>For example, the value of the derivative of the cube function for the
argument 3.14 can be computed by</p>
<pre><code>   3.14   [ dup dup * * ]  deriv  i     ==&gt;     29.5882</code></pre>
<p>We now return to the construction of the newton program. The
functional argument F will be a quotation, and the guess argument will
be a number. Since the Joy program takes a quotation as an argument, it
is really a combinator, and combinators generally expect the quotation
to be on top of the stack, and any further arguments below. So a call to
the Joy program newton will normally take the form</p>
<pre><code>   G  [F]  newton</code></pre>
<p>When the program exits it must leave behind a number on top of the
stack which could be fed into F to yield a small number very close to
zero,</p>
<pre><code>   G  [F]  newton  F            ==&gt;   0  (+/- 0.0001)</code></pre>
<p>The Joy program will have the structure</p>
<pre><code>    newton ==
    &quot;initialise&quot;
    [ &quot;while-part&quot; ]
    [ &quot;do-part&quot; ]
    while
    &quot;finalise&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The do-part will require the quotation [F] and another quotation [D]
for computing the derivative at the current guess. The quotation [D] is
best constructed once and for all, and of course it needs to be
constructed from [F]. This has to be done in the initialisation, so
before the loop is entered and after it exits the stack looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code>   G  [F]  [D]</code></pre>
<p>with [D] topmost. When the loop exits the [F] and [D] quotations are
no longer needed, and the stack element below them is the value to be
returned. This already settles the finalisation:</p>
<pre><code>   pop  pop</code></pre>
<p>In the initialisation the [D] quotation has to be constructed from
the [F] parameter using the deriv program. Now the initialisation can be
written quite simply as</p>
<pre><code>   dup  deriv</code></pre>
<p>The while-part has to determine whether the current guess, the third
element from the top of the stack, when supplied as an argument to F,
gives a value close enough to zero. The first element on the stack is
actually the quotation [D], so that has to be popped off. Below that are
[F] and the current guess, just in the right order for the i combinator.
The result value might be positive or negative, so the absolute value is
taken and compared with 0.0001. So the transliteration of the imperative
program gives the following while-part for the Joy program:</p>
<pre><code>   [ pop i abs 0.0001 &gt; ]</code></pre>
<p>The do-part is more complicated than that. This is partly because the
computation of the new guess has to use the two quotations [F] and [G]
but also retain them for possible further use. Another reason is that,
as can be seen from the DO-part of the imperative version, the current
guess is needed three times to compute the new guess. It so turns out
that it only has to be duplicated once, but that has to be done below
the [F] and the [D], by [[dup] dip] dip, or equivalently by</p>
<pre><code>   [ dupd ]  dip</code></pre>
<p>Following that, the two quotations [F] and [D] have to be duplicated
for future use by a special duplication operator dup2. So the stack at
this point looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>   guess  guess  [F]  [D]  [F]  [D]</code></pre>
<p>After these preliminaries the new guess has to be computed so that
afterwards the stack looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>   newguess  [F]  [D]</code></pre>
<p>in readiness for possibly another sweep through the loop. Following
the assignment statement of the imperative version, the quotations [F]
and [D] can be applied to the uppermost copy of current guess to produce
two values whose ratio is to be subtracted from the lower copy of the
current guess. The result is the new guess:</p>
<pre><code>   cleave  /  -</code></pre>
<p>But the preceding fragment has to be executed below the two
quotations [F] and [D] that were saved for possible later use. So the
fragment has to be executed under the control of a double dip:</p>
<pre><code>   [ [cleave / -]  dip]
    dip</code></pre>
<p>This concludes the design of the do-part, which now is the
following:</p>
<pre><code>   [ [dupd] dip
      dup2
      [[cleave / -] dip]
      dip ]</code></pre>
<p>Finally, assembling the initialisation, the while-part, the do-part
and the finalisation we have the entire newton program as it appears in
the numlib.joy standard library.</p>
<pre><code>    newton ==       (*  Usage: guess [F] newton     *)
    dup deriv       (* guess [F] [D]        *)
    [ pop i abs 0.0001 &gt; ]   (* too big ?           *)
    [ [dupd] dip        (* guess guess [F] [D]      *)

<p>Newton’s algorithm finds arguments for which given function has a
value close to zero. It is easy enough to use the algorithm to find
arguments for which the given function has a particular value other than
zero. For such usage the desired particular value has to be subtracted
from the value given by Newton’s method. Also, a quite arbitrary initial
guess has to be supplied. In this way Newton’s method can be used to
compute the inverse of a given function. In Joy the required program
is</p>
<pre><code>    use-newton == [[-] cons] dip  swoncat  1 swap newton;</code></pre>
<p>For example, the cube-root function is the inverse of the cube
function, and we can define</p>
<pre><code>    cube-root == [dup dup * *] use-newton;</code></pre>
