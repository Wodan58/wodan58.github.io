<h2 id="TOC-1"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>This note was prompted by Nick Forde's version of a Joy operator
which computes the Ackermann function which is one of the few well-known
functions that use nested recursion. He was trying to avoid explicit
recursion in the definition, but found that none of the recursion
combinators of Joy <em>at the time</em> were up to the task. His finding
prompted the inclusion of a new Joy combinator <em>condnestrec</em> into
the language.</p>
<p>This note gives definitions of (the common simplification of)
Ackermann's function, of McCarthy's 91-function, of a function producing
a Hamiltonian path over a hypercube, of a function producing Gray
sequences, and of the Hanoi problem. All involve nested recursion.
Several possible definition methods are used.</p>
<p>The definitions and the output of the examples in this note were
obtained by running the file <a
href="https://github.com/Wodan58/joy1/blob/master/lib/jp-nestrec.joy">jp-nestrec.joy</a>
Only the descriptive text in this note was added later.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-2"><strong>Recursive Definitions</strong></h2>
<p>The following is the more or less standard definition of the
factorial function:</p>
<pre><code>            fact(n) = 
               IF n = 0 
               THEN 1 
               ELSE  n * fact(n-1) </code></pre>
<p>  Here is the corresponding recursive definition in Joy:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE
            r-fact == 
               [ null ] 
               [ pop 1] 
               [ dup pred r-fact *] 
               ifte. </code></pre>
<p>The following tests this definition – redundantly, of course. Note
that the response from Joy is indented to the left. The same style will
be used in all later tests.</p>
<pre><code>        [ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]  [r-fact]  map. 
[1 1 2 6 24 120 720]</code></pre>
<p>The next definition is of a not so familiar function originally due
to McCarthy, his intriguing "91 function":</p>
<pre><code>            mcc91(i) = 
               IF i &gt; 100 
               THEN i - 10 
               ELSE mcc91(mcc91(i + 11)) </code></pre>
<p>Note one very important feature not shared with the factorial
function: In the ELSE-part the recursive call to itself relies on the
result of another recursive call to itself. There are very few function
definitions in which this pattern appears. The following is the
corresponding definition in Joy, note the double recursive call in the
second last line:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            r-mcc91 == 
               [ 100 &gt; ] 
               [ 10 - ] 
               [ 11 + r-mcc91 r-mcc91 ] 
               ifte. </code></pre>
<p>Here is a simple test for some representative values:</p>
<pre><code>        [ -7 42 99 100 101 102 345 ]  [r-mcc91]  map. 
[91 91 91 91 91 92 335]</code></pre>
<p>The Ackermann function widely quoted in the literature is actually a
simplification of the function originally defined by Ackermann to show
that there are terminating recursive functions that are not primitive
recursive. Both the original and the descendent due to Peters grow at an
extraordinary rate. Here is the now common definition:</p>
<pre><code>            ack(m, n) = 
               IF m = 0  THEN n + 1 
               ELSEIF n = 0  THEN ack(m - 1, 1) 
               ELSE ack(m - 1, ack(m, n - 1)) </code></pre>
<p>and its counterpart in Joy:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            r-ack == 
        #       stack putln 
               [ [ [pop null]  popd succ ] 
                 [ [null]  pop pred 1 r-ack ] 
                 [ [dup pred swap] dip pred r-ack r-ack ] ] 
               cond. </code></pre>
<p>The line that has been commented out with the hash character is
useful if one wants to see a trace of what is sitting on the stack. The
following tests are complete from (0,0) up to (3,5), and give some
indication of the behaviour. The final line only gives the value for
(4,0) because computation for (4,1) crashes the Joy stack (and also, it
seems, calculations in other languages).</p>
<pre><code>        [ [0 0] [0 1] [0 2] [0 3] [0 4] [0 5] ]   [i r-ack]  map  putln 
        [ [1 0] [1 1] [1 2] [1 3] [1 4] [1 5] ]   [i r-ack]  map  putln 
        [ [2 0] [2 1] [2 2] [2 3] [2 4] [2 5] ]   [i r-ack]  map  putln 
        [ [3 0] [3 1] [3 2] [3 3] [3 4] [3 5] ]   [i r-ack]  map  putln 
        [ [4 0]                               ]   [i r-ack]  map.

[5 13 29 61 125 253] 
[13]</code></pre>
<p>In the Towers of Hanoi puzzle the disks have to be moved in a
particular order. Ignoring what the target peg is, for three disks the
order is 1 2 1 3 1 2 1. In general for n disks it is a sequence of <span
class="math inline">2<sup>N</sup> - 1</span> steps. In the usual
implementation of the Hanoi program the disks that have to be moved are
not mentioned at all. The sequence of steps is also one that performs a
Hamiltonian path on an n-dimensional hypercube. The following is the Joy
program:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            r-hamilhyp ==   #  [] n  =&gt;  [...] 
               [ null ] 
               [ pop ] 
               [ dup rollup pred       r-hamilhyp 
                 dupd cons swap pred   r-hamilhyp ] 
               ifte. </code></pre>
<p>Note that unlike the program for the 91-function and the Ackermann
function, the two recursive calls are not consecutive. Since the
sequences are less known than the Hanoi program, here are several test
outputs:</p>
<pre><code>        []  3  r-hamilhyp. 
[1 2 1 3 1 2 1]
        []  4  r-hamilhyp. 
[1 2 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 3 1 2 1]
        []  5  r-hamilhyp. 
[1 2 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 5 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 3 1 2 1]</code></pre>
<h2 id="TOC-3">[<strong>Self-application</strong>]</h2>
<p>One way to get by without recursive definitions is by using Curry's
"paradoxical" Y combinator which can also be defined in Joy. Another way
would use what is known as "self-application", giving a function a
parameter which is also a function – e.g. itself. In Joy there is an
inbuilt combinator to this effect, but it might have been defined by</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE
            x == dup i.</code></pre>
<p>Using this combinator a non-recursive definition of the factorial
function is this:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            x-fact == 
               [ [ pop null ] 
                 [ pop pop 1] 
                 [ [dup pred] dip x *] 
                 ifte ] 
               x. </code></pre>
<p>Here is a test, and keep in mind that because the definition of
<code>x-fact</code> is not recursive, as a parameter to the
<code>map</code> combinator instead of using the quotation
<code>[x-fact]</code> it would have been possible to use quotation of
the body of the definition.</p>
<pre><code>        [ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 ]  [x-fact]  map. 
[1 1 2 6 24 120 720]</code></pre>
<p>In the recursive definition of the 91-function the recursive branch
used a double recursion. For a non-recursive version it is necessary to
have a double self-call with the x-combinator. Such a double call is
useful elsewhere, so here we have a definition:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            twice-x == 
               dup [x] dip x. </code></pre>
<p>Below is a non-recursive definition of the 91-function and the same
test set as before:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            x-mcc91 == 
               [ [ pop 100 &gt; ] 
                 [ pop 10 - ] 
                 [ [11 +] dip twice-x ] 
                 ifte ] 
               x. 

        [ -7 42 99 100 101 102 345 ]  [x-mcc91]  map. 
[91 91 91 91 91 92 335]</code></pre>
<p>Exactly the same technique can be used to give a non-recursive
definition of the Ackermann function using the x-combinator. Only one
row of the test matrix is used here:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            x-ack == 
               [ [ [ [pop pop null]  pop popd succ ] 
                   [ [pop null]  [pop pred 1] dip x ] 
                   [ [[dup pred swap] dip pred] dip twice-x ] ] 
               cond ] 
               x. 

        [ [3 0] [3 1] [3 2] [3 3] [3 4] [3 5] ]   [i x-ack]  map. 
[5 13 29 61 125 253]</code></pre>
<p>Whatever may be achieved with the x-combinator can also be achieved
with the less efficient but more familiar y-combinator, which needs to
be defined first:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE
            y ==
               [dup cons] swoncat dup cons i;
            twice-i ==
               dup [i] dip i.

        DEFINE
            y-ack ==
                [ [ [ [pop pop null]  pop popd succ ]
                   [ [pop null]  [pop pred 1] dip i ]
                   [ [[dup pred swap] dip pred] dip twice-i ] ]
               cond ]
               y.

        [ [3 0] [3 1] [3 2] [3 3] [3 4] [3 5] ]   [i y-ack]  map.
[5 13 29 61 125 253]</code></pre>
<p>Here is the non-recursive definition, using the x-combinator, of the
function that generates the Hamiltonian path sequence on a hypercube,
together with one of the tests:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            x-hamilhyp == 
               [ [ pop null ] 
                 [ pop pop ] 
                 [ dup [ [dup rollup pred] dip  x ] dip 
                   [dupd cons] dip 
                   [swap pred] dip  x ] 
                 ifte ] 
               x. 
         
        []  5  x-hamilhyp.

<h2 id="TOC-4"><strong>Partially explicit recursion</strong></h2>
<p>Nick Forde suggested writing the Ackermann function by using the
condlinrec combinator to achieve one recursion, and to use explicit
recursion for the other. For reasons that do not concern us here, his
version computes the <em>converse</em> of the text book definition. For
that reason, in the tests below the call is to [swap ack]:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE ack == (* I:n I:m -&gt; I:a *) 
            [ [ [0 =] [pop 1 +] ] 
              [ [swap 0 =] [popd 1 - 1 swap] [] ] 
              [ [dup rollup [1 -] dip] [swap 1 - ack] ] ] 
            condlinrec. 

        [ [0 0] [0 1] [0 2] [0 3] [0 4] [0 5] ]   [i swap ack]  map  putln 
        [ [1 0] [1 1] [1 2] [1 3] [1 4] [1 5] ]   [i swap ack]  map  putln 
        [ [2 0] [2 1] [2 2] [2 3] [2 4] [2 5] ]   [i swap ack]  map  putln 
        [ [3 0] [3 1] [3 2] [3 3] [3 4] [3 5] ]   [i swap ack]  map  putln 
        [ [4 0]                               ]   [i swap ack]  map.

[3 5 7 9 11 13] 
[5 13 29 61 125 253] 
[13]</code></pre>
<p>In the same style we may define the 91-function using only a
partially recursive definition:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            l-mcc91 == 
               [ 100 &gt; ] 
               [ 10 - ] 
               [ 11 + ] 
               [ l-mcc91 ] 
                linrec. 

        [ -7 42 99 100 101 102 345 ]  [l-mcc91]  map. 
[91 91 91 91 91 92 335]</code></pre>
<p>The following partially recursive definition of the Ackermann
function also uses just the explicitly recursive call in the quotation
for the double recursion:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            clr-ack == 
               [ [ [pop null]  [popd succ] ] 
                 [ [null]  [pop pred 1]  [] ] 
                 [ [[dup pred swap] dip pred]  [clr-ack] ] ] 
               condlinrec. 

        [ [3 0] [3 1] [3 2] [3 3] [3 4] [3 5] ]   [i clr-ack]  map. 
[5 13 29 61 125 253]</code></pre>
<p>In the same style here is the partially recursive definition of the
function for the Hamiltonian path on a hypercube. But since there is
only a two way branching, the linrec combinator is used rather than the
slightly more complex (and hence more flexible) condlinrec combinator.
Remember that the implicit recursion occurs between the third and fourth
quotation.</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE
            lr-hamilhyp == 
               [ null ] 
               [ pop ] 
               [ dup rollup pred ] 
               [ dupd cons swap pred lr-hamilhyp ] 
               linrec. 

        []  5  lr-hamilhyp. 
[1 2 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 5 1 2 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 3 1 2 1]</code></pre>
<p>Using almost the same definition with only a small change we obtain a
definition for something seemingly quite different. In the following
only the commented line has been inserted. The definition generates Gray
sequences of subsets of small numbers. Each subset is generated from its
predecessor by having just one number added or removed. This step is
here done by an operation called <em>toggle</em>, which takes a set of
small numbers and another small number as parameters and returns a set.
If the number was in the original set then it is removed, if the number
was not in the original set then it is added. Here is the definition and
some examples:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            toggle ==   #   {..} i  -&gt;  {..] 
               [has]  [[not] dip swons not]  [swons]  ifte. 

        {}  4  toggle. 
{4}
        {1 2 7}  2 toggle. 
{1 7}</code></pre>
<p>Here is the function which constructs Gray sequences, and three
examples:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            lr-grayseq == 
               [ null ] 
               [ pop ] 
               [ dup rollup pred ] 
               [ dupd 
                 dup [first swap toggle] dip  # inserted line 
                 cons swap pred lr-grayseq ] 
               linrec. 

        [{}]  3  lr-grayseq. 
[{3} {1 3} {1 2 3} {2 3} {2} {1 2} {1} {}]
        [{3}]  3  lr-grayseq. 
[{} {1} {1 2} {2} {2 3} {1 2 3} {1 3} {3}]
        [{1 2 3}]  3 lr-grayseq. 
[{1 2} {2} {} {1} {1 3} {3} {2 3} {1 2 3}]</code></pre>
<h2 id="TOC-5"><strong>A nested recursion combinator</strong></h2>
<p>Nested recursion occurs not only in contrived functions like the
Ackermann function and the 91-function, but also in some others. Since
one of the aims of Joy is to emphasise common patterns, a new recursion
combinator called <code>condnestrec</code> was added to Joy. It
resembles the <code>condlinrec</code> combinator in that it takes just
one parameter which is a list of cases. Each case is a list, all but the
last have a quoted test predicate as their first element. All other
elements in a case list are again quotations. But whereas
<code>condlinrec</code> allows at most two other quotations,
<code>condnestrec</code> allows any number. For both combinators an
implicit recursion occurs between any consecutive other quotations.</p>
<p>Here is the example for the Hamiltonian path on a hypercube. Note
that the parameter to the combinator is a list of just two cases. The
first case consists of a test quotation and another quotation, so there
is no recursion here. The second case is also the last, so it is the
default, and it has no test quotation. There are three quotations, so
the implicit recursion occurs between them, so it occurs twice.</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            cnr-hamilhyp == 
               [ [ [null] [pop] ] 
                 [ [dup rollup pred] 
                   [dupd cons swap pred] 
                   [] ] ] 
               condnestrec. 

        [] 4 cnr-hamilhyp. 
[1 2 1 3 1 2 1 4 1 2 1 3 1 2 1]</code></pre>
<p>In the following definition of the Ackermann function implicit
recursion occurs once in the second case, and twice in the third,
default case. In each of the three places the quotation following the
implicit recursion is actually empty.</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            cnr-ack == 
               [ [ [pop null]  [popd succ] ] 
                 [ [null]  [pop pred 1]  [] ] 
                 [ [[dup pred swap] dip pred]  []  [] ] ] 
               condnestrec. 

        3 4 cnr-ack. 
125</code></pre>
<p>The program for Gray sequences is again obtained from the one for the
Hamiltonian path on a hypercube by inserting one line as indicated:</p>
<pre><code>        DEFINE 
            cnr-grayseq == 
               [ [ [null]  [pop] ] 
                 [ [dup rollup pred] 
                   [dupd 
                    dup [first swap toggle] dip # inserted 
                    cons swap pred] 
                   [] ] ] 
               condnestrec. 

        [{}] 3 cnr-grayseq. 
[{3} {1 3} {1 2 3} {2 3} {2} {1 2} {1} {}]</code></pre>
<p>Since the Hamiltonian path sequence is also the sequence of the disk
numbers in the Hanoi problem, it is perhaps not too surprising that the
solution to the Hamoi problem is so similar. The solution of course has
to specify the pegs: each move has to specify from which peg the top
disk is to be removed and to which peg it is to be moved. However, the
number of the disk is not normally mentioned. In the following program
the number of the disk directs the recursion just as in the Hamiltonian
problem, but the number of the disk does not appear in the output.</p>
<p>In this particular version of the program the user specifies a list
of the names of the three pegs, and the number of disks on the first
peg. The disks on the first peg are to be moved to the peg whose name is
the second on the list, and the peg whose name is the third item can be
used as a temporary. The user chose to call the pegs "source"
"destination" and "temp" in the first example, and "S" "D" and "T" in
the second example.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that although the Gray sequence program and
the Hanoi program are based on the same program, the Hamiltonian path
program, the Gray sequence produced consists of <span
class="math inline">2<sup>n</sup></span> members and the Hanoi move
sequence consists of <span class="math inline">2<sup>N</sup> - 1</span>
members.</p>
<p>Since this note started with the recursive definitions of the
factorial function and the 91-function, This section would not be
complete without the corresponding definitions using the
<em>condnestrec</em> combinator:</p>

<p>In fact, <code>condnestrec</code> is a veritable swiss army knife
combinator. In the following definitions of the <code>even</code>
predicate and the <code>abs</code> (absolute value) operator,
<code>condlinrec</code> is used just for conditionals without making use
of the possibility of recursion. For the <code>abs</code> operator the
default is actually empty.</p>

<p>The use of nested recursion in Joy has not yet been explored beyond
these examples. All the examples took a numeric parameter to guide the
recursion, and one obvious alternative to investigate is the use of
lists.</p>
