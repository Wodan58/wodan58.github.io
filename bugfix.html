<p>30-OCT-01 Fixed Bugs in file interp.c :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>division (/) by zero when one or both operands are
floats</p></li>
<li><p>fremove and frename gave wrong truth value<br />
(now success =&gt; true)</p></li>
<li><p>nullary, unary, binary, ternary had two bugs:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>coredump when there was nothing to push<br />
e.g. 11 22 [pop pop] nullary</p></li>
<li><p>produced circular ("infinite") list when no<br />
new node had been created<br />
e.g. 11 22 [pop] nullary</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>app4 combinator was wrong.<br />
Also renamed: app2 -&gt; unary2, app3 -&gt; unary3, app4 -&gt;
unary4<br />
the old names can still be used, but are declared obsolete.</p></li>
<li><p>Small additions to (raw) Joy:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>putchars – previously defined in library file inilib.joy</p></li>
<li><p>fputchars (analogous, for specified file)<br />
fputstring (== fputchars for Heiko Kuhrt's program)</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
